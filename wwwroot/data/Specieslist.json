It is widespread in the Western Mediterranean.  Having only a limited vascular system and cuticle, clubmosses are confined to dampe shaded locations, however in earlier periods clubmosses formed large, tree-like structures.  As with ferns and higher plants but unlike mosses, the dominant lifeform is the diploid sporophyte.  This produces two spore tyes - male microspores and female megasprores. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It has separate sterile non-reproductive and fertile spore-bearing stems growing from a perennial underground rhizomatous stem system. The fertile stems are produced in early spring and are non-photosynthetic, while the green sterile stems start to grow after the fertile stems have wilted and persist through the summer until the first autumn frosts. It is sometimes confused with mare's tail, <em>Hippuris vulgaris</em>.<br /><br />The sterile stems are 10&ndash;90&nbsp;cm tall and 3&ndash;5&nbsp;mm diameter, with jointed segments around 2&ndash;5&nbsp;cm long with whorls of side shoots at the segment joints; the side shoots have a diameter of about 1&nbsp;mm. Some stems can have as many as 20 segments. The fertile stems are of a succulent texture, off-white, 10&ndash;25&nbsp;cm tall and 3&ndash;5&nbsp;mm diameter, with 4&ndash;8 whorls of brown scale leaves and an apical brown spore cone 10&ndash;40&nbsp;mm long and 4&ndash;9&nbsp;mm broad. It is found in rich and moist soils, cultivable areas or near streams and is little changed from its ancestors of the Carboniferous period.<br /><br /><em>E. arvense</em> is a nonflowering plan, multiplying through spores. It absorbs silicon from the soil, which is rare among herbs. It has a very high diploid number of 216 (108 pairs of chromosomes).<br /><br />The specific name <em>arvense</em> is derived from the Latin <em>arvensis</em>, meaning 'from the meadow, field or grassland.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Most are small, sturdy and evergreen. The leaves, often densely covered in trichomes, spring directly from the rootstocks. Many of them are desert ferns, curling up during dry times and reviving with the coming of moisture. At the ends of veins sporangia, or spore-bearing structures, are protected by leaf margins, which curl over them.<br /><br />This genus is now known to be highly paraphyletic, comprising at least four generically separate groups. The type species, <em>C. micropteris</em>, is most closely allied to the genera <em>Aleuritopteris</em> and <em>Sinopteris</em> (Schuettpelz <em>et al.</em>). In 2012, seventeen species were moved to the new genus <em>Gaga</em>, which also includes two new species.<br /><br />The genus name is derived from the Greek words &chi;&epsilon;?&lambda;&omicron;&sigmaf; (<em>cheilos</em>), meaning 'lip,' and ?&nu;&theta;&omicron;&sigmaf; (<em>anthos</em>), meaning 'flower.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is cultivated as a popular garden fern and houseplant.<br/><br/><em>Adiantum capillus-veneris </em>is native to the southern half of the United States from California to the Atlantic coast, through Mexico and Central America, to South America. It is also native to Eurasia, the Levant in Western Asia, and Australasia. There are two disjunct occurrences in the northern part of North America: at Cascade Springs in the Black Hills of South Dakota and Fairmont Hot Springs, British Columbia. In both instances, the warm microclimate created by hot mineral springs permits the growth of the plant far north of its normal range. It is similar in Zvonce spa resort (???????? ????, Zvona?ka Banja), near Pirot in Serbia, where hot mineral springs provide adequate heat and humidity for the survival of this species. <br/><br/>It is found in temperate climates from warm-temperate to tropical, where the moisture content is high but not saturating, in the moist, well-drained sand, loam or limestone many habitats, including rainforests, shrub and woodlands, broadleaf and coniferous forests, and desert cliff seeps, and springs. It often may be seen growing on moist, sheltered and shaded sandstone or limestone formations, generally south-facing in the southern hemisphere, north-facing in the north, or in gorges. It occurs throughout Africa in moist places by streams. On moist sandstone cliffs it grows in full or partial shade, even when unprotected.<br/><br/><em>Adiantum capillus-veneris </em>grows from 15 to 30 cm in height; its fronds arising in clusters from creeping rhizomes 20 to 70 cm tall, with very delicate, light green fronds much subdivided into pinnae 5 to 10 mm long and broad; the frond rachis is black and wiry. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The extreme lightness of its spores has led to its global distribution.<br /><br />Common bracken was first described as <em>Pteris aquilina</em> by the father of taxonomy, Carl Linnaeus, in Volume 2 of his <em>Species Plantarum</em> in 1753. The origin of the specific epithet derived from the Latin <em>aquila</em> 'eagle', but what it pertains to has been a matter of some debate. It is generally held to be the shape of the mature fronds appearing akin to an eagle's wing. However, medieval scholars, including Erasmus, thought the pattern of the fibres seen in a transverse section of the stipe resembled a double-headed eagle or oak tree. It was given its current binomial name by Friedrich Adalbert Maximilian Kuhn in 1879.<br /><br />It was traditionally treated as the sole species in the genus <em>Pteridium</em> (brackens); authorities have split and recognised up to 11 species in the genus, however.<br /><br />Common bracken is a herbaceous perennial plant, deciduous in winter. The large, roughly triangular fronds are produced singly, arising upwards from an underground rhizome, and grow to 1&ndash;3 m (3&ndash;10&nbsp;ft) tall; the main stem, or stipe, is up to 1&nbsp;cm (0.4&nbsp;in) diameter at the base.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The tree is native to the Mediterranean region, occurring in Southern Europe, Israel, Lebanon and Syria. It is also naturalized in North Africa, the Canary Islands, South Africa and New South Wales. The species was introduced into North Africa millennia ago, such a long time that it is essentially indistinguishable from being native.<br /><br />Stone pines have been used and cultivated for their edible pine nuts since prehistoric times. They are widespread in horticultural cultivation as ornamental trees, planted in gardens and parks around the world.<br /><br />The stone pine is a coniferous evergreen tree that can exceed 25 metres (82&nbsp;ft) in height, but 12&ndash;20 metres (39&ndash;66&nbsp;ft) is more typical. In youth, it is a bushy globe, in mid-age an umbrella canopy on a thick trunk, and, in maturity, a broad and flat crown over 8 metres (26&nbsp;ft) in width. The bark is thick, red-brown and deeply fissured into broad vertical plates.<br /><br /><strong>Foliage</strong><br /><br />The flexible mid-green leaves are needle-like, in bundles of two, and are 10&ndash;20 centimetres (3.9&ndash;7.9&nbsp;in) long (exceptionally up to 30 centimetres (12&nbsp;in)). Young trees up to 5&ndash;10&nbsp;years old bear juvenile leaves, which are very different, single (not paired), 2&ndash;4 centimetres (0.79&ndash;1.57&nbsp;in) long, glaucous blue-green; the adult leaves appear mixed with juvenile leaves from the fourth or fifth year on, replacing it fully by around the tenth year. Juvenile leaves are also produced in regrowth following injury, such as a broken shoot, on older trees.<br /><br /><strong>Cones</strong><br /><br />The cones are broad, ovoid, 8&ndash;15 centimetres (3.1&ndash;5.9&nbsp;in) long, and take 36&nbsp;months to mature, longer than any other pine.

			"Description": "<em><strong>Taxus baccata</strong></em> is a conifer native to western, central and southern Europe, northwest Africa, northern Iran and southwest Asia. It is the tree originally known as <strong>yew</strong>, though with other related trees becoming known, it may now be known as <strong>English yew</strong>, or <strong>European yew</strong>.<br /><br />It is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing 10&ndash;20 metres (33&ndash;66&nbsp;ft) (exceptionally up to 28 metres (92&nbsp;ft)) tall, with a trunk up to 2 metres (6&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in) (exceptionally 4 metres (13&nbsp;ft)) diameter. The bark is thin, scaly brown, coming off in small flakes aligned with the stem. The leaves are flat, dark green, 1&ndash;4 centimetres (0.39&ndash;1.57&nbsp;in) long and 2&ndash;3 millimetres (0.079&ndash;0.118&nbsp;in) broad, arranged spirally on the stem, but with the leaf bases twisted to align the leaves in two flat rows either side of the stem, except on erect leading shoots where the spiral arrangement is more obvious. The leaves are poisonous.<br /><br />The seed cones are modified, each cone containing a single seed, which is 4&ndash;7 millimetres (0.16&ndash;0.28&nbsp;in) long, and partly surrounded by a fleshy scale which develops into a soft, bright red berry-like structure called an aril. The aril is 8&ndash;15 millimetres (0.31&ndash;0.59&nbsp;in) long and wide and open at the end. The arils mature 6 to 9 months after pollination, and with the seed contained, are eaten by thrushes, waxwings and other birds, which disperse the hard seeds undamaged in their droppings. Maturation of the arils is spread over 2 to 3 months, increasing the chances of successful seed dispersal. The seeds themselves are poisonous and bitter, but are opened and eaten by some bird species including hawfinches, greenfinches and great tits. The aril is not poisonous, it is gelatinous and very sweet tasting. The male cones are globose, 3&ndash;6 millimetres (0.12&ndash;0.24&nbsp;in) diameter, and shed their pollen in early spring. The yew is mostly dioecious, but occasional individuals can be variably monoecious, or change sex with time<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

Similar trees in the Atlas Mountains of northwest Africa are usually included in this species, or sometimes treated as a distinct species <em>Quercus tlemcenensis</em>. It occurs in mountains between 0&ndash;1900&nbsp;metres altitude, and flourishes in a variety of soils and climates.<br /><br /><em>Quercus faginea</em> is a medium-sized deciduous or semi-evergreen tree growing to 20 meters tall, with a trunk up to 80&nbsp;cm in diameter, with grey-brown bark. The tree can live as long as 600&nbsp;years. The leaves are 4&ndash;10&nbsp;cm long and 1.2&ndash;4&nbsp;cm broad (rarely to 15&nbsp;cm long and 5&nbsp;cm broad), glossy dark green to grey-green above, and variably felted grey-white below; the margins have 5-12 pairs of irregular teeth. Leaf fall is typically in mid to late winter. The flowers are catkins, produced between March and April, almost always before Holm oak, which grows in similar areas. The acorns are oblong-ovoid, 2&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm long, maturing in 6&nbsp;months to disperse in September or October.<br /><br />The species commonly develops galls due to gall wasp activity; the galls are brown, 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm diameter, and have a spongy, cork-like interior.<br /><br />There are two subspecies:<ul><li><em>Quercus faginea</em> subsp. <em>faginea</em>. Iberian Peninsula.</li><li><em>Quercus faginea</em> subsp. <em>broteroi</em> (Cout.) A.Camus (syn. <em>Quercus tlemcenensis</em>). Northwest Africa and South-West of the Iberian Peninsula.</li></ul>Portuguese oak also hybridises readily with other related oaks such as Algerian oak (<em>Quercus canariensis</em>) and downy oak (<em>Quercus pubescens</em>), which can make identification difficult.<br /><br />The scientific name <em>faginea</em> refers to the superficial resemblance of the leaves to those of the beech (<em>Fagus</em>).<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It takes its name from holm, an ancient name for holly. It is a member of the white oak section of the genus, with acorns that mature in a single summer.<br /><br />The first trees to be grown from acorns in England are still to be found within the stately grounds of Mamhead Park, Devon. From Britton &amp; Brayley <em>The Beauties of England and Wales</em> (1803):<br /><br />'The woods and plantations of Mamhead are numerous and extensive. Many of them were introduced by Mr Thomas Balle (sic), the last of that family who, on returning from the continent brought with him a quantity of cork, ilex, wainscot, oak; Spanish chestnut, acacia, and other species of exotic trees.'<br /><br />An evergreen tree of large size, attaining in favourable places a height of 21&ndash;28&nbsp;m, and developing in open situations a huge head of densely leafy branches as much across, the terminal portions of the branches usually pendulous in old trees. The trunk is sometimes over 6&nbsp;m in girth. The young shoots are clothed with a close grey felt. The leaves are very variable in shape, most frequently narrowly oval or ovate-lanceolate, 4&ndash;8&nbsp;cm long, 1.2&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm wide, rounded or broadly tapered at the base, pointed, the margins sometimes entire, sometimes (especially on young trees) more or less remotely toothed. When quite young, both surfaces are clothed with whitish down, which soon falls away entirely from the upper surface leaving it a dark glossy green; on the lower surface it turns grey or tawny, and persists until the fall of the leaf; the petiole is 3&ndash;16&nbsp;mm long. Fruits are produced one to three together on a short downy stalk, ripening the first season; the acorns usually 12&ndash;18&nbsp;mm long in the UK, the cups with appressed, downy scales.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<strong>Willows</strong>, also called <strong>sallows</strong>, and <strong>osiers</strong>, form the genus <em><strong>Salix</strong></em>, around 400 species<sup>[2]</sup> of deciduous trees and shrubs, found primarily on moist soils in cold and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Most species are known as willow, but some narrow-leaved shrub species are called <strong>osier</strong>, and some broader-leaved species are referred to as <strong>sallow</strong> (from Old English <em>sealh</em>, related to the Latin word <em>salix</em>, willow). Some willows (particularly arctic and alpine species) are low-growing or creeping shrubs; for example, the dwarf willow (<em>Salix herbacea</em>) rarely exceeds 6&nbsp;cm (2.4&nbsp;in) in height, though it spreads widely across the ground.<br /><br />Willows all have abundant watery bark sap, which is heavily charged with salicylic acid, soft, usually pliant, tough wood, slender branches, and large, fibrous, often stoloniferous roots. The roots are remarkable for their toughness, size, and tenacity to live, and roots readily sprout from aerial parts of the plant.<br /><br />The leaves are typically elongated, but may also be round to oval, frequently with serrated edges. Most species are deciduous; semievergreen willows with coriaceous leaves are rare, e.g. <em>Salix micans</em> and <em>S. australior</em> in the eastern Mediterranean. All the buds are lateral; no absolutely terminal bud is ever formed. The buds are covered by a single scale. Usually, the bud scale is fused into a cap-like shape, but in some species it wraps around and the edges overlap. The leaves are simple, feather-veined, and typically linear-lanceolate. Usually they are serrate, rounded at base, acute or acuminate. The leaf petioles are short, the stipules often very conspicuous, resembling tiny, round leaves, and sometimes remaining for half the summer. On some species, however, they are small, inconspicuous, and caducous (soon falling). In color, the leaves show a great variety of greens, ranging from yellowish to bluish.<br /><br />Willows are dioecious, with male and female flowers appearing as catkins on separate plants; the catkins are produced early in the spring, often before the leaves.<br /><br />The staminate (male) flowers are without either calyx or corolla; they consist simply of stamens, varying in number from two to 10, accompanied by a nectariferous gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is itself borne on the rachis of a drooping raceme called a catkin, or ament. This scale is square, entire, and very hairy. The anthers are rose-colored in the bud, but orange or purple after the flower opens; they are two-celled and the cells open longitudinally. The filaments are threadlike, usually pale brown, and often bald.<br /><br />The pistillate (female) flowers are also without calyx or corolla, and consist of a single ovary accompanied by a small, flat nectar gland and inserted on the base of a scale which is likewise borne on the rachis of a catkin. The ovary is one-celled, the style two-lobed, and the ovules numerous.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

It also occurs at one site in northwest Africa in Algeria. In the south of its range, it occurs at high altitudes in mountains.<br /><br />The English name <em>Waverly</em>, meaning 'quaking aspen', is both a surname and unisex given name.<br /><br />It is a substantial deciduous tree growing to 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft) tall by 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) broad, with a trunk attaining over 1&nbsp;m (3&nbsp;ft) in diameter. The bark is pale greenish-grey and smooth on young trees with dark grey diamond-shaped lenticels, becoming dark grey and fissured on older trees. The adult leaves, produced on branches of mature trees, are nearly round, slightly wider than long, 2&ndash;8&nbsp;cm (1&ndash;3&nbsp;in) diameter, with a coarsely toothed margin and a laterally flattened petiole 4&ndash;8&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;3&nbsp;in) long. The flat petiole allows them to tremble in even slight breezes, and is the source of its scientific name, as well as one of its vernacular names 'langues de femmes' attributed to Gerard's 17th-century <em>Herball</em>. The leaves on seedlings and fast-growing stems of suckers (root sprouts) are of a different shape, heart-shaped to nearly triangular. They are also often much larger, up to 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) long; their petiole is also less flattened.<sup>[<em>citation needed</em>]</sup> The flowers are wind-pollinated catkins produced in early spring before the new leaves appear; they are dioecious, with male and female catkins on different trees. The male catkins are patterned green and brown, 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;4&nbsp;in) long when shedding pollen; the female catkins are green, 2&ndash;6&nbsp;cm (1&ndash;2&nbsp;in) long at pollination, maturing in early summer to bear 10&ndash;20 (50&ndash;80) capsules each containing numerous tiny seeds embedded in downy fluff. The fluff assists wind dispersal of the seeds when the capsules split open at maturity.<br /><br />It can be distinguished from the closely related North American <em>Populus tremuloides</em> by the leaves being more coarsely toothed.<br /><br />Like other aspens, it spreads extensively by suckers (root sprouts), which may be produced up to 40 m from the parent tree, forming extensive clonal colonies.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"Commonname": "Field Elm",
			"Description": "<em><strong>Ulmus minor</strong></em><small>Mill.</small>, the <strong>field elm</strong>, is by far the most polymorphic of the European species, although its taxonomy remains a matter of contention. Its natural range is predominantly south European, extending to Asia Minor and Iran; its northern outposts are the Baltic islands of &Ouml;land and Gotland, although it may have been introduced here by man. The tree's typical habitat is low-lying forest along the main rivers, growing in association with oak and ash, where it tolerates summer floods as well as droughts.<br /><br />Current treatment of the species owes much to Richens, who noted (1983) that several varieties of field elm are distinguishable on the European mainland. Of these, he listed the small-leaved <em>U. minor</em> of France and Spain; the narrow-leaved <em>U. minor</em> of northern and central Italy; the densely hairy leaved <em>U. minor</em> of southern Italy and Greece; the <em>U. minor</em> with small-toothed leaves from the Balkans; the <em>U. minor</em> with large-toothed leaves from the Danube region; and the small-leaved <em>U. minor</em> from southern Russia and Ukraine. As for British varieties, 'the continental populations most closely related [to eastern English Field Elm] are in central Europe', while south-western forms were introduced from France. He concluded, however, that owing to incomplete field-research at the time of writing, it was 'not possible to present an overall breakdown of the European Field Elm into regional varieties'.<br /><br />Richens sank a number of British elms, notably English elm, as either subspecies or varieties of <em>U. minor</em> in 1968. However, Melville, writing ten years later, identified five distinct species (including <em>U. glabra</em> in the count), several varieties and numerous complex hybrids. In 1992 Armstrong identified no fewer than forty British species and microspecies. Clive Stace (1997) wrote of the British elms 'The two-species (<em>glabra</em> and <em>minor</em>) concept of Richens is not sufficiently discriminating to be of taxonomic value'. Nevertheless, it is Richens&rsquo; classification which has been the most commonly adopted in recent years, although it is not used in <em>Flora Europaea</em><br /><br />In 2009 Dr Max Coleman of the Royal Botanic Garden, Edinburgh wrote: 'The advent of DNA fingerprinting has shed considerable light on the question. A number of studies have now shown that the distinctive forms Melville elevated to species and Richens lumped together as field elm are single clones, all genetically identical, which have been propagated by vegetative means such as cuttings or root suckers. This means that enigmatic British elms such as Plot elm and English elm have been shown to be single clones of field elm. Although Richens did not have the evidence to prove it, he was correct in recognising a series of clones and grouping them together as a variable species.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"species": "carica",
			"Commonname": "Fig",
			"Description": "<em><strong>Ficus carica</strong></em> is an Asian species of flowering plant in the mulberry family, known as the <strong>common fig</strong> (or just the <strong>fig</strong>). It is the source of the fruit also called the fig, and as such is an important crop in those areas where it is grown commercially. Native to the Middle East and western Asia, it has been sought out and cultivated since ancient times, and is now widely grown throughout the world, both for its fruit and as an ornamental plant. The species has become naturalized in scattered locations in Asia and North America.<h3>Description</h3><em>Ficus carica</em> is a gynodioecious (functionally dioecious), deciduous tree or large shrub, growing to a height of 7&ndash;10 metres (23&ndash;33&nbsp;ft), with smooth white bark. Its fragrant leaves are 12&ndash;25 centimetres (4.7&ndash;9.8&nbsp;in) long and 10&ndash;18 centimetres (3.9&ndash;7.1&nbsp;in) across, and deeply lobed with three or five lobes. The complex inflorescence consists of a hollow fleshy structure called the syconium, which is lined with numerous unisexual flowers. The flowers themselves are not visible from outside the syconium, as they bloom inside the infructescence. Although commonly referred to as a fruit, the fig is actually the infructescence or scion of the tree, known as a false fruit or multiple fruit, in which the flowers and seeds are borne. It is a hollow-ended stem containing many flowers. The small orifice (ostiole) visible on the middle of the fruit is a narrow passage, which allows the specialized fig wasp <em>Blastophaga psenes</em> to enter the fruit and pollinate the flower, whereafter the fruit grows seeds. <em>See Ficus: Fig fruit and reproduction system.</em><br /><br />The edible fruit consists of the mature syconium containing numerous one-seeded fruits (druplets). The fruit is 3&ndash;5 centimetres (1.2&ndash;2.0&nbsp;in) long, with a green skin, sometimes ripening towards purple or brown. <em>Ficus carica</em> has milky sap (laticifer). The sap of the fig's green parts is an irritant to human skin.<br /><br />The common fig tree has been cultivated since ancient times and grows wild in dry and sunny areas, with deep and fresh soil; also in rocky areas, from sea level to 1,700 meters. It prefers relatively light free-draining soils, and can grow in nutritionally poor soil. Unlike other fig species, <em>Ficus carica</em> does not always require pollination by a wasp or from another tree, but can be pollinated by the fig wasp, <em>Blastophaga psenes</em> to produce seeds. Fig wasps are not present to pollinate in colder countries like the United Kingdom.<br /><br />The plant can tolerate seasonal drought, and the Middle Eastern and Mediterranean climate is especially suitable for the plant. Situated in a favorable habitat, old specimens when mature can reach a considerable size and form a large dense shade tree. Its aggressive root system precludes its use in many urban areas of cities, but in nature helps the plant to take root in the most inhospitable areas. The common fig tree is mostly a phreatophyte that lives in areas with standing or running water. It grows well in the valleys of the rivers and ravines saving no water, having strong need of water that is extracted from the ground. The deep-rooted plant searches groundwater, in aquifers, ravines, or cracks in the rocks. The fig tree, with the water, cools the environment in hot places, creating a fresh and pleasant habitat for many animals that take shelter in its shade in the times of intense heat.<br /><br />The mountain or rock fig ('Anjeer Kohi', ????? ????, in Persian) is a wild variety, tolerant of cold dry climates, of the semi-arid rocky mountainous regions of Iran, especially in the Kohestan Mountains of Khorasan.<h3>Ecology</h3><em>Ficus carica</em> is dispersed by birds and mammals that scatter their seeds in droppings. Fig fruit is an important food source for much of the fauna in some areas, and the tree owes its expansion to those that feed on its fruit. The common fig tree also sprouts from the root and stolon issues.<br /><br />The infructescence is pollinated by a symbiosis with a kind of fig wasp (<em>Blastophaga psenes</em>). The fertilized female wasp enters the fig through the scion, which has a tiny hole in the crown (the ostiole). She crawls on the inflorescence inside the fig and pollinates some of the female flowers. She lays her eggs inside some of the flowers and dies. After weeks of development in their galls, the male wasps emerge before females through holes they produce by chewing the galls. The male wasps then fertilize the females by depositing semen in the hole in the gall. The males later return to the females and enlarge the holes to enable the females to emerge. Then some males enlarge holes in the scion, which enables females to disperse after collecting pollen from the developed male flowers. Females have a short time (&lt;48 hours) to find another fig tree with receptive scions to spread the pollen, assist the tree in reproduction, and lay their own eggs to start a new cycle<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

It has also been called <strong>Irish moss</strong>; however, it is not a moss, nor should it be confused with <em>Sagina subulata</em> or <em>Chondrus crispus</em> (an alga), which are also known as 'Irish moss'.<h2>Description</h2>It is a delicate-looking creeping herb with juicy bright green or yellow leaves and multitudes of tiny white flowers. It grows close to the ground in mats and is sometimes used in ornamental gardens alongside ferns and other moisture-loving types of plant.<br /><br />The leaves are usually slightly stalked, about 5 mm across. The minute flowers produce oval seeds.<h2>Distribution</h2>This species is native to the northern Mediterranean region in and around Italy and nearby islands, but it has been introduced and cultivated nearly worldwide as an ornamental and garden plant. It has been recorded from the north east of Ireland in counties Antrim and Down.<h2>Habitat</h2>It can be grown indoors as a houseplant and used in habitats for amphibians. It prefers shade and moderate moisture. It can even grow submerged in swampy environments. In colder regions, the plant dies back during winter, but it returns with lush growth as the temperature increases. It is capable of vegetative reproduction, so to eradicate it once it has become established in an area, the entire plant must be removed, or else it can sprout new growth. It is a common weed in many places.<sup>[7]</sup> Nurseries grow several varieties, including gold, yellow, and white breeds, but the mossy-green type is most popular with gardeners.<br /><br />This species, the only member of the monotypic genus, <em><strong>Soleirolia</strong></em>, was named after Joseph-Fran&ccedil;ois Soleirol by Esprit Requien. Soleirol, an amateur botanist, originally collected the plant in Corsica.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

The plant's pollen is highly allergenic. In Australia it is also known as <strong>asthma weed</strong>, due to the high incidence of allergy. It is unrelated to the herb pellitory (<em>Anacyclus pyrethrum</em>). It is easily confused with the very similar species <em>Parietaria officinalis</em>.<br /><br />The biological form of <em>Parietaria judaica</em> is hemicryptophyte scapose, as its overwintering buds are situated just below the soil surface and the floral axis is more or less erect. This plant has pink or red hairy stems, woody at the base. It reaches on average a height of 60 centimetres (24&nbsp;in). The leaves are hairy, alternate, simple, entire and green, with smooth margins. The tiny white or pink flowers are attached to the stems. They are bisexual or unisexual, produced in clusters of three to many together in the leaf axils. The nickname <em>sticky-weed</em> is due to the adherent quality of the flowers and of the hairy stems; unlike some related species of the family Urticaceae, the hairs do not sting. The flowering period extends from spring through autumn, when it produces large amounts of pollen. The fruits are blackish achenes.<br /><br />Generally considered a weed, it is often found on roadsides, along dry stone walls and in cracks of buildings and rock faces. However, it might useful in a habitat garden within its native range, as it is a larval food plant for red admiral butterflies. It is the host plant for the larvae of butterflies of the genus <em>Vanessa</em>. The ideal habitat is the dry places, at an altitude of 0&ndash;1,000 metres (0&ndash;3,281&nbsp;ft) above sea level.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

H.Gross, <em>Fagopyrum carinatum</em> Moench, <em>Helxine convolvulus</em> (L.) Raf., <em>Reynoutria convolvulus</em> (L.) Shinners, and <em>Tiniaria convolvulus</em> (L.) Webb &amp; Moq. Other old folk names include bear-bind, bind-corn, climbing bindweed, climbing buckwheat, corn-bind, corn bindweed, devil's tether, and wild buckwheat<h2>Description</h2>Black-bindweed is a herbaceous vine growing to 1&ndash;1.5&nbsp;m (39&ndash;59&nbsp;in) long, with stems that twine clockwise round other plant stems. The alternate triangular leaves are 1.5&ndash;6&nbsp;cm long and 0.7&ndash;3&nbsp;cm broad with a 6&ndash;15 (&ndash;50) mm petiole; the basal lobes of the leaves are pointed at the petiole. The flowers are small, and greenish-pink to greenish white, clustered on short racemes. These clusters give way to small triangular achenes, with one seed in each achene.<br /><br />While it superficially resemble bindweeds in the genus <em>Convolvulus</em> there are many notable differences; it has ocrea (stipule-sheath at nodes), which <em>Convolvulus</em> does not; and <em>Convolvulus</em> has conspicuous trumpet-shaped flowers while Black-bindweed has flowers that are unobtrusive and only about 4&nbsp;mm long.<h2>Ecology</h2><em>Fallopia convolvulus</em> grows most commonly on disturbed or cultivated land, in northern Europe typically on warm, sunny, well-drained sandy or limestone soil types, but in hotter, drier areas like Pakistan, on moist shady sites.

It has shown some weedy behaviour in restricted areas within southern Australia.<br /><br />The lesser jack tends to grow as a sprawling weed. The leaves are plain in shape, resembling spinach. The flowers of different sexes are clustered separately on the same plant. The plant produces many seeds with a hard, prickly casing. These are produced both in clusters along the branches and at the base of the stem. The root is thick and succulent. At the end of the plant's life, the root dries up and pulls the seeds at the base of the stem into the ground. The spiny, durable seeds make the plant a nuisance around human habitats, much like the similarly shaped seeds of Tribulus terrestris.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Bassia hyssopifolia</strong></em> is a species of flowering plant in the amaranth family, Amaranthaceae, known by the common names <strong>five-horn smotherweed</strong>, <strong>five-hook bassia</strong>, and <strong>thorn orache</strong>. It is native to parts of Asia and Eastern Europe, and it is known on other continents as an introduced species, including North and South America and Australia. It is a weed, invasive at times.<br /><br />The Latin word <em>hyssopifolia</em> (which also occurs in several other plant names, including that of cuphea hyssopifolia) means 'hyssop-leafed'.<h2>Description</h2>This species is an annual herb with simple or branching stems usually growing up to a metre tall, or sometimes taller. The leaf blades are flat and linear to lance-shaped. The lowest leaves are up to 6 centimetres long. The inflorescence is a short, narrow spike occupying the upper stem. It is lined with woolly-haired flowers growing solitary, paired, or in clusters of three. The small flower has five segments, each of which has a hooked spine at maturity. The fruit is less than 2 millimetres long. The hooked spines of the flower persist on the dry fruit.<br /><br />This species resembles kochia (<em>Bassia scoparia</em>), but it has longer, hairier flower spikes. It has been mistaken for Russian thistle (<em>Kali tragus</em>), but it is less branched and less spiny. It is also similar to lamb's quarters (<em>Chenopodium album</em>), but its leaves are smaller and narrow to a point.<h2>Distribution</h2>This plant is native to Eurasia and was first described from the Caspian Sea region. It may have spread beyond its native range as a seed contaminant, possibly of alfalfa seed. It was first recorded in North America in 1915 near Fallon, Nevada. By 1921 it was noted in the Central Valley of California, and by 1940 it was present from British Columbia to Wyoming and had established in eastern North America. The seeds are probably dispersed when the spiny dry fruits catch in animal fur and feathers, and human activity such as road maintenance may aid their spread and establishment.<h2>Biology</h2>This plant grows easily in alkaline and saline soils. While it has been known to displace native flora at times, it is more persistent than competitive; it simply tolerates stress better than many other plants. On land with little disturbance, native plants can replace it. It generally does not have a strong negative effect on local ecosystems. Infestations are rarely severe.<br /><br />Livestock will graze on the plant, but it is toxic to them, particularly to sheep, which have been known to die after just one feeding. The foliage contains potassium oxalate. It has been cited as one of the major plant species causing oxalate poisoning in ruminants.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Beta vulgaris</strong></em> (<strong>beet</strong>) is a plant which is included in Betoideae subfamily in the Amaranthaceae family. It is the economically most important crop of the large order Caryophyllales. It has several cultivar groups: the sugar beet, of greatest importance to produce table sugar; the root vegetable known as the beetroot or garden beet; the leaf vegetables chard and spinach beet; and mangelwurzel, which is a fodder crop. Three subspecies are typically recognised. All cultivars fall into the subspecies <em>Beta vulgaris</em> subsp. <em>vulgaris</em>. The wild ancestor of the cultivated beets is the sea beet (<em>Beta vulgaris</em> subsp. <em>maritima</em>).<h2>Description</h2><em>Beta vulgaris</em> is an herbaceous biennial or, rarely, perennial plant up to 120&nbsp;cm (rarely 200&nbsp;cm) height; cultivated forms are mostly biennial. The roots of cultivated forms are dark red, white, or yellow and moderately to strongly swollen and fleshy (subsp. <em>vulgaris</em>); or brown, fibrous, sometimes swollen and woody in the wild subspecies. The stems grow erect or, in the wild forms, often procumbent; they are simple or branched in the upper part, and their surface is ribbed and striate. The basal leaves have a long petiole (which may be thickened and red, white, or yellow in some cultivars). The simple leaf blade is oblanceolate to heart-shaped, dark green to dark red, slightly fleshy, usually with a prominent midrib, with entire or undulate margin, 5&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long on wild plants (often much larger in cultivated plants). The upper leaves are smaller, their blades are rhombic to narrowly lanceolate.<br /><br />The flowers are produced in dense spike-like, basally interrupted inflorescences. Very small flowers sit in one- to three- (rarely eight-) flowered glomerules in the axils of short bracts or in the upper half of the inflorescence without bracts. The hermaphrodite flowers are urn-shaped, green or tinged reddish, and consist of five basally connate perianth segments (tepals), 3-5 &times; 2&ndash;3&nbsp;mm, 5 stamens, and a semi-inferior ovary with 2-3 stigmas. The perianths of neighbouring flowers are often fused. Flowers are wind-pollinated.<sup>[<em>citation needed</em>]</sup><br /><br />In fruit, the glomerules of flowers form connate hard clusters. The fruit (utricle) is enclosed by the leathery and incurved perianth, and is immersed in the swollen, hardened perianth base. The horizontal seed is lenticular, 2&ndash;3&nbsp;mm, with a red-brown, shiny seed coat. The seed contains an annular embryo and copious perisperm (feeding tissue).<br /><br />The chromosome number is 2n=18.<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>The wild forms of <em>Beta vulgaris</em> are distributed in southwestern, northern and Southeast Europe along the Atlantic coasts and the Mediterranean Sea, in North Africa, Macaronesia, to Western Asia. Naturalized they occur in other continents. The plants grow at coastal cliffs, on stony and sandy beaches, in salt marshes or coastal grasslands, and in ruderal or disturbed places.<br /><br />Cultivated beets are grown worldwide in regions without severe frosts. They prefer relatively cool temperatures between 15 and 19&nbsp;&deg;C, leaf beets can thrive in warmer temperatures than beetroot. As descendants of coastal plants, they tolerate salty soils and drought. They grow best on pH-neutral to slightly alkaline soils containing plant nutrients and additionally Sodium and Boron.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).<br /><br />The JS beautifier will take care of your dirty JavaScript codes, assuring a syntax error-free solution.",

It is native to arid and semi-arid regions of the Middle East, North Africa and southern Europe where it is used as a fodder plant for livestock.<h2>Description</h2><em>Salsola vermiculata</em> is a small, greyish, much-branched shrub ranging in height from 25 to 100&nbsp;cm (10 to 40&nbsp;in). The branches themselves branch repeatedly and are wiry and woody at the base. The leaves are tiny and scale-like, clasping the stem and covered with minute hairs. The inflorescence is a leafy spike with solitary flowers in the axils of the leaves. The flowers have persistent, pinkish, winged sepals and no petals and are about 10&nbsp;mm (0.4&nbsp;in) in diameter.<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2>This plant is native to Syria, Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia, as well as Egypt and Morocco. It is also native to southern Europe, including Italy, Spain and Portugal. Its natural habitat is semi-arid and arid grassland, and it has been introduced to Pakistan and to California to provide forage in arid locations. In California it has become a weed and is regarded as an invasive species.<h2>Ecology</h2><em>Salsola vermiculata</em> is part of the climax community in the Syrian steppe where it grows alongside <em>Artemisia herba-alba</em>, <em>Atriplex leucoclada</em> and <em>Stipa barbata</em>. It also grows on the Jordanian steppe along with <em>Artemisia herba-alba</em> and <em>Achillea fragrantissima</em>, but all three of these useful fodder species are becoming increasingly rare because of overgrazing. Exclusion of livestock from an area produces a large increase in the biomass of these species. It has a high protein content and is of high value as a forage crop in arid areas. It is planted in the Middle East for grazing by cattle, sheep, goats and camels.<br /><br />Natural regeneration occurs in both spring and autumn, but plants germinating in autumn are more drought tolerant and more likely to become established.<sup>[6]</sup> Rainwater harvesting, in the form of contouring furrows that prevent run-off, increases the successful establishment and growth of <em>S. vermiculata</em>. Planting this and other native species, such as <em>Atriplex halimus</em>, shows high potential for the improvement of the Badia rangelands in Syria. Prolonged drought sometimes caused the plants to shed their leaves.<br /><br />In California, <em>S. vermiculata</em> has been shown to be an alternate host for the plant viruses that cause curly top, a disease of sugar beet, tomatoes and cucurbits.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"Commonname": "Saltwort; Barilla plant",
			"Description": "<em><strong>Salsola soda</strong></em>, more commonly known in English as <strong>opposite-leaved saltwort</strong>, <strong>oppositeleaf Russian thistle,</strong> or <strong>barilla plant,</strong> is a small (to 0.7 m tall), annual, succulent shrub that is native to the Mediterranean Basin. It is a halophyte (a salt-tolerant plant) that typically grows in coastal regions and can be irrigated with salt water.<br /><br />The plant has great historical importance as a source of soda ash, which was extracted from the ashes of <em>Salsola soda</em> and other saltwort plants. Soda ash is one of the alkali substances that are crucial in glassmaking and soapmaking. The famed clarity of 16th century <em>cristallo</em> glass from Murano and Venice depended upon the purity of 'Levantine soda ash,' and the nature of this ingredient was kept secret. Spain had an enormous 18th century industry that produced soda ash from the saltworts (<em>barrilla</em> in Spanish). Soda ash is now known to be predominantly sodium carbonate. In 1807, Sir Humphry Davy isolated a metallic element from caustic soda; he named the new element 'sodium' to indicate its relationship to 'soda.' Before soda was synonymous (in U.S. English) with soft drinks, the word referred to <em>Salsola soda</em> and other saltwort plants, and to 'sodas' derived from soda ash.<br /><br />While the era of farming for soda ash is long past, <em>Salsola soda</em> is still cultivated as a vegetable that enjoys considerable popularity in Italy and with gourmets around the world. Its common names in Italian include <strong>barba di frate</strong>, <strong>agretti</strong>, and <strong>liscari sativa</strong> (short: <strong>lischi</strong> or <strong>lischeri</strong>). Of its culinary value, Frances Mayes has written that 'Spinach is the closest taste, but while <em>agretti</em> has the mineral sharpness of spinach, it tastes livelier, full of the energy of spring.'<br /><br />This annual, succulent plant can grow into small shrubs up to 0.7 meters tall (sometimes called sub-shrubs). It has fleshy green leaves with either green or red stems. The tiny flowers develop from inflorescences that grow out of the base of the leaves near the stem.<br /><br />The ashes obtained by the burning of <em>Salsola soda</em> can be refined to make a product called soda ash, which is one of the alkali materials essential to making soda-lime glass, soap, and many other products. The principal active ingredient is sodium carbonate, with which the term 'soda ash' is now nearly synonymous. The processed ashes of <em>Salsola soda</em> contain as much as 30% sodium carbonate.<br /><br />A high concentration of sodium carbonate in the ashes of <em>Salsola soda</em> occurs if the plant is grown in highly saline soils (i.e. in soils with a high concentration of sodium chloride), so that the plant's tissues contain a fairly high concentration of sodium ions. <em>Salsola soda</em> can be irrigated with sea water, which contains about 40 grams per liter of dissolved sodium chloride and other salts. When these sodium-rich plants are burned, the carbon dioxide that is produced presumably reacts with this sodium to form sodium carbonate.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

It is native to coastal areas of the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea and parts of the Middle East, where it grows in coastal and inland salt marshes, alkali flats, and other habitats with saline soils.<h2>Description</h2><em>Arthrocnemum macrostachyum</em> is a much-branched subshrub growing in clumps up to a metre high (3 ft). The plants have horizontal woody stems that may root at the nodes, branching into erect, jointed, succulent green stems. The leaves are small and scale-like, clasping the stem but with the tips free. The flowers are minute, produced in threes in terminal, cylindrical spikes. The perianth is conical and has three teeth. The hermaphrodite flowers are wind-pollinated, and the fruit is small, has a membranous pericarp, and contains a single seed.<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2><em>A. macrostachyum</em> is found around the coasts bordering on the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, and ranges northwards into the Jordan Valley. It is also present in the Middle East, including Iran and Pakistan, where it grows in the muddy coastal swamps immediately inland from the mangroves (<em>Avicennia marina</em>) that border the coast. In the delta region of the Mediterranean coast of Egypt, it dominates some plant communities in the salt marsh habitats.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

It is native to the eastern United States and has significant toxicity.<br /><br />It has simple leaves on green to red or purplish stems and a large white taproot. The flowers are green to white, followed by purple to almost black berries which are a food source for songbirds such as gray catbird, northern mockingbird, northern cardinal, and brown thrasher, as well as other birds and some small animals (i.e., to species that are unaffected by its mammalian toxins).<br /><br />Pokeweed&mdash;also known by a number of other names&mdash;is native to eastern North America, the Midwest, and the Gulf Coast, with more scattered populations in the far West.<sup>[<em>not verified in body</em>]</sup> It is also naturalized in parts of Europe and Asia. It is considered a major pest species by farmers. Additionally, pokeweed poses a danger to human and animal populations via poisoning; with toxicity levels increasing as the plant matures, and poisonous fruit. This very poisonous purple-red ripe fruit poses danger to children and animals who may want to taste it. For these reasons many support eradication of <em>P. americana.</em> Even so, it is used as an ornamental in horticulture, and it provokes interest for the variety of its natural products (toxins and other classes), for its ecological role, its historical role in traditional medicine, and for some utility in biomedical research (e.g., in studies of pokeweed mitogen). In the wild, it is easily found growing in pastures, recently cleared areas, and woodland openings, edge habitats such as along fencerows, and in waste places<br /><br />Pokeweed is a member of the Phytolaccaceae, or broader pokeweed family, and is a native herbaceous perennial plant, that is large, growing up to 8 feet (2 meters) in height. One to several branches grow from the crown of a thick, white, fleshy taproot, each a 'stout, smooth, green to somewhat purplish stem;' with simple, entire leaves with long petioles alternately arranged along the stem.<sup>[3]</sup><br /><br />Pokeweeds reproduce only by its seeds (large glossy black, and lens-shaped), contained in a fleshy, 10-celled, purple-to-near-black berry with crimson juice. The flowers are perfect, radially symmetric, white or green, with 4-5 sepals and no petals. The flowers develop in elongated clusters termed racemes. The seeds have a long viability and can germinate after many years in the soil.<br /><br />Birds are unaffected by the natural chemicals contained in the berries (see below), and eat them, dispersing the seeds. Seed are also found in commercial seed (e.g., vegetable seed packets). The berries are reported to be a good food source for songbirds and other bird species and small animals unaffected by its toxins. Distribution via birds is thought to account for the appearance of 'single, isolated plants' in areas that had otherwise not been populated by pokeweed.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

It is native to northern Africa, the Mediterranean region and the Middle East where it grows on arid sandy plains, saline areas and in semi-arid habitats. It was first described as <em>Aizoon hispanicum</em> by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1753 and was in 2002 placed in the genus <em>Aizoanthemum</em> by the German botanist Heidrun Hartmann.<br /><br /><em>A. hispanicum</em> is a sprawling annual herbaceous plant 5 to 20&nbsp;cm (2 to 8&nbsp;in) high with opposite, papillose, succulent leaves. These are lanceolate with entire margins. The solitary flowers have five white tepals which are yellowish green on the outside, 5 to 15 stamens and an ovary with 5 locules giving a pentagonal fruit capsule containing 2 brown seeds in each locule.<br /><br />The fruits have an unusual mechanism for dispersing the seeds. When it rains, the locules gradually fill with water. Near the centre of the capsule, the covering membranes are arranged in such a way that they form a nozzle, and when further rain drops fall on the capsule, a jet of water and seeds is propelled through this nozzle; this allows the plant to scatter its seeds much more widely than is the case in related species that lack this mechanism.<h2>Distribution and habitat</h2><em>A. hispanicum</em> is native to Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Syria, Cyprus, Turkey, Iraq, Iran and the Arabian Peninsula where it grows in compacted sandy soil in desert plains, saline areas and semi-arid regions. It also grows in the Mediterranean region and the Canary Islands.<h2>Ecology</h2>It has been found that the seeds of <em>A. hispanicum</em> germinate poorly in the laboratory when placed on a filter paper in the dark at 30&nbsp;&deg;C (86&nbsp;&deg;F). The germination rate can be improved by placing some soil nearby, by covering the seeds for a few days and then uncovering them, or by placing some covered seeds nearby. This suggests that both soil and covered seeds give out some gas, possibly ethylene, which stimulates germination in nearby uncovered seeds.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia).",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</strong></em> is a prostrate succulent plant native to Africa, Sinai and southern Europe, and naturalized in North America, South America and Australia.<sup>[1]</sup> The plant is covered with large, glistening bladder cells or water vesicles, reflected in its common names of <strong>common ice plant</strong>, <strong>crystalline ice plant</strong> or <strong>ice plant</strong>.<br /><br /><em>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</em> is covered with bladder cells, enlarged epidermal cells. The main function of these bladder cells is to reserve water.<br /><br />It flowers from spring to early summer. Flowers open in the morning and close at night, and are insect pollinated.<br /><br />It can be annual, biennial or perennial, but its life cycle is usually completed within several months, depending on environmental conditions.<h2>Habitat</h2><em>Mesembryanthemum crystallinum</em> is found on a wide range of soil types, from well-drained sandy soils (including sand dunes), to loamy and clay soils. It can tolerate nutritionally poor or saline soils. As with many introduced species it also grows in disturbed sites such as roadsides, rubbish dumps and homestead yards.<h2>Biology</h2>The plant usually uses C3 carbon fixation, but when it becomes water- or salt-stressed, it is able to switch to Crassulacean acid metabolism. Like many salt-tolerant plants, <em>M. crystallinum</em> accumulates salt throughout its life, in a gradient from the roots to the shoots, with the highest concentration stored in epidermal bladder cells. The salt is released by leaching once the plant dies. This results in a detrimental osmotic environment preventing the growth of other, non-salt-tolerant species while allowing <em>M. crystallinum</em> seeds to germinate.<br /><br />In <em>M. crystallinum</em>, the number of seeds produced depends on whether CAM has been activated (C3 metabolism is more efficient) and the size the plant has grown to in its juvenile growth phase. During seed production, older portions of the plant progressively die off and dry out. The developing seed capsules continue to sequester salt and produce viable seeds. Seeds at the top of the capsule generally germinate immediately on imbibation while seeds at the base may remain dormant for longer than four weeks.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is the type species for the genus. It is native to Israel and Jordan, as also endemic to southern Africa, but it is known in many other places as an introduced species and sometimes an invasive weed, including several regions of Australia, parts of the western United States and adjacent Mexico, and some Atlantic islands. This is a usually annual herb forming a mostly prostrate clump or mat of stems up to about 20 centimeters in maximum length. The small stem branches are lined with knob-like cylindrical fleshy leaves up to 2 centimeters long. The herbage is green to bright red and visibly bumpy with shiny, bubble-like papillae. Flowers are solitary or borne in loose clusters. Each is about half a centimeter wide with many narrow to thready white or pale yellow petals. The fruit is a capsule which opens when it becomes wet, releasing seeds.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

This plant has many common names, including <strong>common soapwort</strong>, <strong>bouncing-bet</strong>, <strong>crow soap</strong>, <strong>wild sweet William</strong>, and <strong>soapweed</strong>. There are about 20 species of soapworts altogether.<br /><br />The scientific name <em>Saponaria</em> is derived from the Latin <em>sapo</em> (stem <em>sapon-</em>) meaning 'soap,' which, like its common name, refers to its utility in cleaning. From this same Latin word is derived the name of the toxic substance saponin, contained in the roots at levels up to 20 percent when the plant is flowering (Indian soapnuts contain only 15 percent). It produces a lather when in contact with water. The epithet <em>officinalis</em> indicates its medicinal functions.<br /><br /><em>Saponaria officinalis</em>' native range extends throughout Europe, and in Asia to western Siberia. It grows in cool places at low or moderate elevations under hedgerows and along the shoulders of roadways.<br /><br />The plants possesses leafy, unbranched stems (often tinged with red). It grows in patches, attaining a height of 70&nbsp;cm. The broad, lanceolate, sessile leaves are opposite and between 4 and 12&nbsp;cm long. Its sweetly scented flowers are radially symmetrical and pink, or sometimes white. Each of the five flat petals have two small scales in the throat of the corolla. They are about 2.5&nbsp;cm wide. They are arranged in dense, terminal clusters on the main stem and its branches. The long tubular calyx has five pointed red teeth.<br /><br />The individual flowers open in the evening, and stay open for about three days. They produce a stronger scent at night and supplement nectar production during the night. The flowers are protandrous: on the second night of blooming, the pollen is released, and the stigma develops to its final position by the third night. Much of the seed production comes from self-pollination. The flowers are visited by various insects including Noctuidae, Sphingidae, bumblebees, and hoverflies.<br /><br />In the northern hemisphere <em>Saponaria officinalis</em> blooms from May to September, and in the southern hemisphere October to March.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Sparsely hairy, with hairs in a line along the stem. The leaves are oval and opposite, the lower ones with stalks. Flowers are white and small with 5 very deeply lobed petals.

It is also a popular aquarium plant.<br /><br />An aquatic plant, <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em> has stems that reach lengths of 1&ndash;3&nbsp;m (3&ndash;10&nbsp;ft), with numerous side shoots making a single specimen appear as a large, bushy mass. The leaves are produced in whorls of six to twelve, each leaf 8&ndash;40&nbsp;mm long, simple, or forked into two to eight thread-like segments edged with spiny teeth; they are stiff and brittle. It is monoecious, with separate male and female flowers produced on the same plant. The flowers are small, 2&nbsp;mm long, with eight or more greenish-brown petals; they are produced in the leaf axils. The fruit is a small nut 4&ndash;5&nbsp;mm long, usually with three spines, two basal and one apical, 1&ndash;12&nbsp;mm long. Plants with the two basal nut spines very short are sometimes distinguished as <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em> var. <em>apiculatum</em> (Cham.) Asch., and those with no basal spines sometimes distinguished as <em>Ceratophyllum demersum</em> var. <em>inerme</em> Gay ex Radcl.-Sm. It can form turions: buds that sink to the bottom of the water that stay there during the winter and form new plants in spring.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Nigella damascena</strong></em> (<strong>love-in-a-mist</strong>, <strong>ragged lady</strong> or <strong>devil in the bush</strong>) is an annual garden flowering plant, belonging to the buttercup family Ranunculaceae. It is native to southern Europe (but adventive in more northern countries of Europe), north Africa and southwest Asia, where it is found on neglected, damp patches of land.<br /><br />The specific epithet <em>damascena</em> relates to Damascus in Syria. The plant's common name comes from the flower being nestled in a ring of multifid, lacy bracts.<br /><br />It grows to 20&ndash;50&nbsp;cm (8&ndash;20&nbsp;in) tall, with pinnately divided, thread-like, alternate leaves. The flowers, blooming in early summer, are most commonly different shades of blue, but can be white, pink, or pale purple, with 5 to 25 sepals. The actual petals are located at the base of the stamens and are minute and clawed. The sepals are the only colored part of the perianth. The four to five carpels of the compound pistil have each an erect style.<br /><br />The fruit is a large and inflated capsule, growing from a compound ovary, and is composed of several united follicles, each containing numerous seeds. This is rather exceptional for a member of the buttercup family. The capsule becomes brown in late summer. The plant self-seeds, growing on the same spot year after year<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is found wild in many parts of England, especially on limestone soil.<br /><br />It is an evergreen perennial growing to 80&nbsp;cm (31&nbsp;in) tall and 100&nbsp;cm (39&nbsp;in) across, with a thick succulent stem and glossy leaves. The drooping cup-shaped flowers appear in spring, and are yellowish-green, often with a purple edge to the five petal-like sepals on strongly upright stems. The flowers, typically for the family, contain numerous stamens as well as up to ten nectaries which make them attractive to bees and other insects. Each flower produces up to five (usually three) wrinkled follicles. Despite its common name, it is not noticeably malodorous, although the foliage is pungent when crushed.<br /><br />All parts of the plant are poisonous, containing glycosides. Symptoms of intoxication include violent vomiting and delirium.<br /><br />Yeasts colonise the nectaries of stinking hellebore and their presence has been found to raise the temperature of the flower, which may aid in attracting pollinators to the flower by increasing the evaporation of volatile organic compounds. It was the first species in which this effect was discovered.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The dark-colored, wrinkled seeds of <em>D. staphisagria</em> are characteristically quite large (~5x6 mm), and it is likely that the species name, which translates to 'wild raisin' (classical Greek: &sigma;&tau;&alpha;&phi;?&sigmaf; ?&gamma;&rho;?&alpha;) is based on their appearance.

It is native to Europe, but it can be found in many other places in the world, including parts of Africa, Australia, and the western and eastern United States, as an introduced species and agricultural and roadside weed. It grows in wet habitats, such as irrigation ditches. It is an annual or sometimes biennial herb producing a mostly hairless stem up to half a meter long which may grow erect or decumbent along the ground. The leaves have blades a few centimetres in length which are deeply divided into three lobes or split into three leaflets. They are hairless to hairy in texture, and are borne at the tips of long petioles. The flower has five shiny yellow petals under 1 centimetre (0.4&nbsp;in) long around a lobed central receptacle studded with many stamens and pistils. The fruit is a spiny achene borne in a spherical cluster of 10 to 20.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is also called creeping crowfoot and (along with restharrow) sitfast.<br /><br />It is a herbaceous, stoloniferous perennial plant growing to 50&nbsp;cm tall. It has both prostrate running stems, which produce roots and new plants at the nodes, and more or less erect flowering stems. The basal leaves are compound, borne on a 4&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long petiole and divided into three broad leaflets 1.5&ndash;8&nbsp;cm long, shallowly to deeply lobed, each of which is stalked. The leaves higher on the stems are smaller, with narrower leaflets and may be simple and lanceolate. Both the stems and the leaves are finely hairy. The flowers are golden yellow, glossy, and 2&ndash;3&nbsp;cm diameter, usually with five petals, and the flower stem is finely grooved. The gloss is caused by the smooth upper surface of the petal that acts like a mirror; the gloss aids in attracting pollinating insects and thermoregulation of the flower's reproductive organs. The fruit is a cluster of achenes 2.5&ndash;4&nbsp;mm long. Creeping buttercup has three-lobed dark green, white-spotted leaves that grow out of the node.

It has fleshy dark green, heart-shaped leaves and distinctive flowers with bright yellow, glossy petals. It is now introduced in North America, where it is known by the common name <strong>fig buttercup</strong> and considered an invasive species. The plant is poisonous if ingested raw and potentially fatal to grazing animals and livestock such as horses, cattle, and sheep. For these reasons, several US states have banned the plant or listed it as a noxious weed. It prefers bare, damp ground and is considered by horticulturalists in the United Kingdom as a persistent garden weed. Emerging in late winter with flowers appearing March through May, its appearance across the landscape is regarded by many as a harbinger of spring.<br /><br />Lesser celandine is a hairless perennial, with spirally-arranged cordate dark-green leaves without stipules. It produces actinomorphic (radially symmetrical) flowers with 3 sepaloid tepals and 7-12 glossy yellow petaloid tepals. Double flowered varieties also occur. The stamens and carpels are numerous, and the fruit is a single-seeded achene with a very short style. In several sub-species, tubers are formed in the leaf axils after flowering. It blooms between March and May in the UK.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The stems, major veins and undersides of the leaves remain purple red, while the upper surface of the leaves turns into a metallic bluish green when fully grown and its lower leaves consist of no more than nine leaflets or segments. This endemic of the Balearic Islands is now limited to parts of northeastern and northwestern Majorca. In English it is sometimes called <strong>Balearic peony</strong> or <strong>Majorcan peony</strong>.<br /><br /><em>Paeonia cambessedesii</em> is a clump-forming, perennial, herbaceous peony, which dies down in the autumn, and overwinters with buds just under the surface of the soil, and may reach a height of 25&ndash;60&nbsp;cm. The reddish purple stem carries several alternately arranged leaves. The lowest leaves consist of nine leathery, hairless leaflets which are lanceolate to inverted egg-shaped with a pointy tip. The upper surface of the leafblade is bluish green with a metallic gloss, while the main veins are reddish purple, and the underside of the leafblade is purple. Each stem carries one cup-shaped flower of 6&ndash;12&nbsp;cm with usually eight (5-10) pale to purplish pink petals, and is said to smell of roses. Within is a circle of numerous purple filaments topped by yellow anthers. The center of the flower consists of three to nine, initially purple carpels, each of which is connected through a thick style with a reddish stigma on top. The stigmas ripen before the stamens, a situation called protogyny. The three to eight (mostly four to six) carpels develop into dry dehiscent fruits (called follicles) of about 6&nbsp;cm long, that open with a suture along their lengths, and contain initially carmine colored seeds that turn glossy black when fully ripe.<br /><br /><em>P. cambessedesii</em> differs from all other peonies as its lower leaves have (seven to) nine entire leaflets, never more or incised, all its parts are absolutely hairless, it has on average more carpels per flower than any other Eurasian herbaceous peony: (3-) 4-6 (-8), and it has nearly always reddish purple stems and undersides of the leaves throughout the season. It is most related to <em>P. russoi</em>, from Corsica and Sardinia, but that species is a tetraploid, and the upper surface of its leaves retain a purple hue even when fully developed.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to the Mediterranean region and is used as bay leaf for seasoning in cooking. Its common names include <strong>bay laurel</strong>, <strong>sweet bay</strong>, <strong>bay</strong> (esp. United Kingdom), <strong>true laurel</strong>, <strong>Grecian laurel</strong>, <strong>laurel tree</strong> or simply <strong>laurel</strong>. <em>Laurus nobilis</em> figures prominently in classical Greek, Roman, and Biblical culture.<br /><br />Worldwide, many other kinds of plants in diverse families are also called 'bay' or 'laurel', generally due to similarity of foliage or aroma to <em>Laurus nobilis</em>, and the full name is used for the California bay laurel (<em>Umbellularia</em>), also in the family Lauraceae.<br /><br />The laurel is an evergreen shrub or small tree, variable in size and sometimes reaching 7&ndash;18 metres (23&ndash;59&nbsp;ft) tall. The genus <em>Laurus</em> includes four accepted species, whose diagnostic key characters often overlap (Mabberley 1997).<br /><br />The bay laurel is dioecious (unisexual), with male and female flowers on separate plants. Each flower is pale yellow-green, about 1&nbsp;cm diameter, and they are borne in pairs beside a leaf. The leaves are glabrous, 6&ndash;12&nbsp;cm long and 2&ndash;4&nbsp;cm broad, with an entire (untoothed) margin. On some leaves the margin undulates. The fruit is a small, shiny black berry-like drupe about 1&nbsp;cm long that contains one seed.<br /><br />A recent study found considerable genetic diversity within <em>L. nobilis</em>, and that <em>L. azorica</em> is not genetically or morphologically distinct.<br /><br /><em>Laurus nobilis</em> is a widespread relic of the laurel forests that originally covered much of the Mediterranean Basin when the climate of the region was more humid. With the drying of the Mediterranean during the Pliocene era, the laurel forests gradually retreated, and were replaced by the more drought-tolerant sclerophyll plant communities familiar today. Most of the last remaining laurel forests around the Mediterranean are believed to have disappeared approximately ten thousand years ago, although some remnants still persist in the mountains of southern Turkey, northern Syria, southern Spain, north-central Portugal, northern Morocco, Canary Islands and in Madeira.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

In the northern hemisphere it generally flowers in late spring, (between May and October in the UK,) but if the weather is warm enough other flowers frequently appear at the beginning of autumn. It grows up to about 70&nbsp;cm in height. The stems hold single flowers, which are large and showy, 50 to 100mm across, with four petals that are vivid red, most commonly with a black spot at their base.

Other parts of <em>Capparis</em> plants are used in the manufacture of medicines and cosmetics.<br /><br /><em>Capparis spinosa</em> is found in the wild in the Mediterranean, East Africa, Madagascar, South-Western and Central Asia, the Himalayas, the Pacific Islands, Indomalaya, and Australia. It is present in almost all the circum-Mediterranean countries, and is included in the flora of most of them, but whether it is indigenous to this region is uncertain. Although the flora of the Mediterranean region has considerable endemism, the caper bush could have originated in the tropics, and later been naturalized to the Mediterranean basin.<br /><br />The taxonomic status of the species is controversial and unsettled. Species within the genus <em>Capparis</em> are highly variable, and interspecific hybrids have been common throughout the evolutionary history of the genus. As a result, some authors have considered <em>C. spinosa</em> to be composed of multiple distinct species, others that the taxon is a single species with multiple varieties or subspecies, or that the taxon <em>C. spinosa</em> is a hybrid between <em>C. orientalis</em> and <em>C. sicula</em>.<br /><br />The shrubby plant is many-branched, with alternate leaves, thick and shiny, round to ovate.

Native to Asia (or, according to some authorities, the Mediterranean), it has been introduced into most parts of the world, and is regarded as a damagingly invasive species in many areas, for example Australia. It spreads rapidly, and is often found growing on roadsides or in other places where the ground has been disturbed.<br /><br />In southeastern USA, the pale yellow form is common, sometimes entirely taking over fields in wintertime. It is often erroneously identified as mustard. It is a significant source of pollen and nectar for a variety of pollinators, especially honey bees during the very early spring starting buildup. Female <em>Andrena agilissima</em>, mining bees<em>,</em> frequent this plant to obtain pollen and nectar.<br /><br />Wild radish grows as an annual or biennial plant, with attractive four-petalled flowers 30&ndash;40&nbsp;mm across and varying in colour, usually from white to purple but sometimes light orange to yellow, often with colour shading within a single petal. It is frost hardy, and even hard freezes only temporarily interrupt bloom. It blooms in early spring to late summer with flowers very similar to those of the searocket, which is found in some of the same regions and is easily distinguished from it by having thinner, non-succulent stems and leaves. It has a single taproot which is similar to that of the cultivated radish but less enlarged.<br /><br />The genome of wild radish is estimated to be ~515 Mb. Approximately 49% of the genome (254 Mb) has been sequenced. researchers found evidence of a past whole-genome triplication in wild radish followed by widespread gene loss, resulting in ~38,000 genes in the genome of the extant species.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The English common name, <em>rocket</em>, derives from the French <em>roquette</em>, a diminutive of the Latin word <em>eruca</em>, which designated an unspecified plant in the Brassicaceae family (probably a type of cabbage).<br /><br /><em>Eruca sativa</em> grows 20&ndash;100 centimetres (8&ndash;39&nbsp;in) in height. The pinnate leaves have four to ten small, deep, lateral lobes and a large terminal lobe. The flowers are 2&ndash;4&nbsp;cm (0.8&ndash;1.6&nbsp;in) in diameter, arranged in a corymb in typical Brassicaceae fashion; with creamy white petals veined with purple, and with yellow stamens; the sepals are shed soon after the flower opens. The fruit is a siliqua (pod) 12&ndash;35 millimetres (0.5&ndash;1.4&nbsp;in) long with an apical beak, and containing several seeds (which are edible). The species has a chromosome number of 2<em>n</em> = 22.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Cardamine hirsuta</strong></em>, commonly called <strong>hairy bittercress</strong>, is an annual or biennial member of the mustard family (Brassicaceae), and is edible as a bitter herb. It is a common weed in moist areas and has been transported to many new regions by humans.<br /><br />Depending on the climate <em>C. hirsuta</em> may complete two generations in a year, one in the spring and one in the fall; also depending on the climate, the seeds may germinate in the fall and the plants may remain green throughout the winter before flowering in the spring. It often grows a rosette of leaves at the base of the stem, while there may be leaves on the upright stem, most of the leaves will be part of the basal rosette. The leaves in this rosette are pinnately divided into 8-15 leaflets which have short stems connecting them to the petiole. These basal leaves are often 3.5-15 cm long. The leaflets are round to ovate in shape and may have smooth or dentate edges. The leaflet at the tip of the leaf (terminal leaflet) will be larger than the other leaflets and round to reniformly shaped. The cauline (attached to the upright stem) leaves are also pinnately divided, with fewer leaflets, and generally smaller than the basal leaves; these leaves will be borne on a petiole and are 1.2-5.5 cm long. The stems, petioles, and upper surfaces of the cauline leaves are sparsely hairy.<div>&nbsp;Plants of this species are usually erect and grow to no more than 30 centimetres (12&nbsp;in) from a stem which is either unbranched or branched near the base. The small white flowers are borne in a raceme without any bracts, soon followed by the seeds and often continuing to flower as the first seeds ripen. The flowers have (4) white petals (which may be lacking but are mostly present) which are 1.5-4.5 mm long and spatulate shaped. The flowers also and have (4) stamens of equal height instead of the 6 which are found in most closely related plants. Below the flowers there are 4 sepals which are oblong shaped and 1.5-2.5 mm long and .3-.7 mm wide. The seeds are borne in upright pointing siliquae which are straight and 1.5-2.5 cm long and 1-1.4mm in diameter. When the fruit is ripe the valves on the siliquae will coil tightly from the bottom to the top after being touched and burst explosively, sending the seeds flying far from the parent plant. This seed dispersal strategy is referred to as ballochory and is a type of rapid plant movement.</div>Hairy bittercress is very similar to <em>Cardamine flexuosa</em>. Some differences are that the stems are hairless and the leaves do not clasp the stems, as in <em>C.flexuosa</em>. It has only 4 stamens, <em>C. flexuosa</em> has 6 stamens, and the fruits overtop the flowers. In <em>C. flexuos</em> the fruits do not overtop the younger flowers. The fruits grow in a thin pod arranged as a single row.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to eastern Europe and Asia minor but is naturalized and considered a common weed in many parts of the world, especially in colder climates, including British Isles where it is regarded as an archaeophyte, North America and China but also in the Mediterranean and North Africa. <em>Capsella bursa-pastoris</em> is closely related to the model organism <em>Arabidopsis thaliana</em> and is also used as a model organism due to the variety of genes expressed throughout its life cycle that can be compared to genes that are well studied in <em>A. thaliana</em>. Unlike most flowering plants, it flowers almost all year round. Like other annual ruderals exploiting disturbed ground, <em>C. bursa-pastoris</em> reproduces entirely from seed, has a long soil seed bank, and short generation time and is capable of producing several generations each year.<br /><br /><em>C. bursa-pastoris</em> plants grow from a rosette of lobed leaves at the base. From the base emerges a stem about 0.2 to 0.5&nbsp;m tall, which bears a few pointed leaves which partly grasp the stem. The flowers, which appear in any month of the year in the British Isles, are white and small, (2.5&nbsp;mm in diameter) with four petals and six stamens. They are borne in loose racemes, and produce flattened, two-chambered seed pods known as siliques, which are triangular to heart-shaped, each containing several seeds.<br /><br />Like a number of other plants in several plant families, its seeds contain a substance known as mucilage, a condition known as myxospermy. The adaptive value of myxospermy is unknown, although the fact that mucilage becomes sticky when wet has led some to propose that <em>C. bursa-pastoris</em> traps insects which then provide nutrients to the seedling, which would make it protocarnivorous.<br /><br />Common on cultivated ground, waysides and waste places, disturbed land and roadworks.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Common names include <strong>dyer's rocket</strong>, <strong>dyer's weed</strong>, <strong>weld</strong>, <strong>woold</strong>, and <strong>yellow weed</strong>. A native of Eurasia, the plant can be found in North America as an introduced species and common weed.<br /><br />While other resedas were used for the purpose, this species was the most widely used source of the natural dye known as weld. The plant is rich in luteolin, a flavonoid which produces a bright yellow dye. The yellow could be mixed with the blue from woad (<em>Isatis tinctoria</em>) to produce greens such as Lincoln green. The dye was in use by the first millennium BC, and perhaps earlier than either woad or madder. Use of this dye came to an end at the beginning of the twentieth century, when cheaper synthetic yellow dyes came into use. France exported large quantities of weld.<br /><br />It prefers waste places. Good weld for dye must have flowers of a yellow or greenish color, and abound in leaves; that which is small, thin-stemmed, and yellow is better than that which is large, thick-stemmed, and green; that which grows on dry, sandy soils is better than that produced on rich and moist soils. For the greatest production of coloring matter, the plant should be cut before the fruits show much development, otherwise the pigment diminishes. Dye from weld serves equally for linen, wool, and silk, dyeing with proper management all shades of yellow, and producing a bright and beautiful color.<br /><br />Reseda is a primary dye for the wool tapestries at the Ramses Wissa Wassef Art Centre in Giza, Egypt. Each February, the reseda is harvested for the annual wool dyeing event among all the artists at the centre.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it can be found in parts of the Americas and Australia as an introduced species. It is also cultivated as an ornamental plant for its spikelike racemes of fragrant white flowers. This is an annual or perennial herb growing up to a meter tall. The leaves are divided deeply into many narrow lobes. The inflorescence, which may take up most of the upper stem, is densely packed with many white flowers. Each flower has five or six petals, each of which is divided into three long, narrow lobes, making the raceme appear frilly. The fruit is a nearly rectangular four-angled capsule up to 1.4 centimeters in length.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to Japan, China, and Korea, but it is used throughout the world as an ornamental plant in landscaping and as cut foliage.<br /><br />It is an evergreen shrub which can reach 10&nbsp;m (33&nbsp;ft) tall by 3&nbsp;m (10&nbsp;ft) broad, and can become treelike. It can also be trimmed into a hedge. The leaves are oval in shape with edges that curl under and measure up to 10&nbsp;cm (4&nbsp;in) in length. They are leathery, hairless, and darker and shinier on the upper surfaces. The inflorescence is a cluster of fragrant flowers occurring at the ends of branches. The flower has five white petals each about a centimetre long. The fruit is a hairy, woody capsule about 1 cm wide divided into three valves. Inside are black seeds in a bed of resinous pulp.<br /><br />The binomial qualifier <em>tobira</em> derives from the Japanese name for the plant.<br /><br />This shrub is a common, drought-tolerant and fairly hardy landscaping plant. Many cultivars have been developed, including dwarf forms and the popular 'Variegata', which has variegated leaves. It is used for hedges, living privacy screens, and indoor and outdoor planter boxes. The stems, leaves, and dried fruits are used in flower arrangements.<br /><br />Common pests of this plant include various aphids, mites, and leafhoppers, the cotton cushiony scale (<em>Icerya purchasi</em>), and root-knot nematodes (<em>Meloidogyne</em> spp.). It can be attacked by the pit-making pittosporum scale (<em>Planchonia arabidis</em>). It is vulnerable to the fungal plant pathogen <em>Erythricium salmonicolor</em>, which causes galls and the dieback disease known as pink limb blight.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>almond</strong> (<em>Prunus dulcis</em>, syn. <em>Prunus amygdalus</em>) is a species of tree native to the Middle East, the Indian subcontinent and North Africa.<br /><br />'Almond' is also the name of the edible and widely cultivated seed of this tree. Within the genus <em>Prunus</em>, it is classified with the peach in the subgenus <em>Amygdalus</em>, distinguished from the other subgenera by corrugations on the shell (endocarp) surrounding the seed.<br /><br />The fruit of the almond is a drupe, consisting of an outer hull and a hard shell with the seed, which is not a true nut, inside. Shelling almonds refers to removing the shell to reveal the seed. Almonds are sold shelled or unshelled. Blanched almonds are shelled almonds that have been treated with hot water to soften the seedcoat, which is then removed to reveal the white embryo.<h2>Description</h2><h3>Tree</h3>The almond is a deciduous tree, growing 4&ndash;10&nbsp;m (13&ndash;33&nbsp;ft) in height, with a trunk of up to 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in diameter. The young twigs are green at first, becoming purplish where exposed to sunlight, then grey in their second year. The leaves are 3&ndash;5&nbsp;inches long, with a serrated margin and a 2.5&nbsp;cm (1&nbsp;in) petiole. The flowers are white to pale pink, 3&ndash;5&nbsp;cm (1&ndash;2&nbsp;in) diameter with five petals, produced singly or in pairs and appearing before the leaves in early spring. Almond grows best in Mediterranean climates with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. The optimal temperature for their growth is between 15 and 30&nbsp;&deg;C (59 and 86&nbsp;&deg;F) and the tree buds have a chilling requirement of 300 to 600 hours below 7.2&nbsp;&deg;C (45.0&nbsp;&deg;F) to break dormancy.<br /><br />Almonds begin bearing an economic crop in the third year after planting. Trees reach full bearing five to six years after planting. The fruit matures in the autumn, 7&ndash;8 months after flowering.<h3>Drupe</h3>The almond fruit measures 3.5&ndash;6&nbsp;cm (1&ndash;2&nbsp;in) long. In botanical terms, it is not a nut but a drupe. The outer covering or exocarp, fleshy in other members of <em>Prunus</em> such as the plum and cherry, is instead a thick, leathery, grey-green coat (with a downy exterior), called the hull. Inside the hull is a reticulated, hard, woody shell (like the outside of a peach pit) called the endocarp. Inside the shell is the edible seed, commonly called a nut. Generally, one seed is present, but occasionally two occur.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Throughout history the cooked fruit has been used as food, but the tree is also grown for its attractive pale pink blossoms and other ornamental qualities.<br /><br />The tree grows 5 to 8&nbsp;m (16 to 26&nbsp;ft) high and 4 to 6&nbsp;m (13 to 20&nbsp;ft) wide. The fruit is 7 to 12&nbsp;cm (3 to 5&nbsp;in) long and 6 to 9&nbsp;cm (2 to 4&nbsp;in) across.<br /><br />The immature fruit is green with dense grey-white fine hair, most of which rubs off before maturity in late autumn when the fruit changes color to yellow with hard, strongly perfumed flesh. The leaves are alternately arranged, simple, 6&ndash;11&nbsp;cm (2&ndash;4&nbsp;in) long, with an entire margin and densely pubescent with fine white hairs. The flowers, produced in spring after the leaves, are white or pink, 5&nbsp;cm (2&nbsp;in) across, with five petals.<br /><br />The seeds contain nitriles, which are common in seeds of the rose family. In the stomach, enzymes or stomach acid or both cause some of the nitriles to be hydrolyzed and produce hydrogen cyanide, which is a volatile gas.

When the genus <em>Mespilus</em> is included in the genus <em>Crataegus</em>, the correct name for this species is <em><strong>Crataegus germanica</strong></em> Kuntze.<br /><br /><em>Mespilus germanica</em> requires warm summers and mild winters and prefers sunny, dry locations and slightly acidic soil. Under ideal circumstances, the deciduous plant grows up to 8 metres (26&nbsp;ft) tall. Generally, it is shorter and more shrub-like than tree-like. With a lifespan of 30&ndash;50 years, the medlar tree is rather short-lived. Its bark is greyish brown with deep vertical cracks forming rectangular plates that tend to lift off. The leaves are dark green and elliptic, 8&ndash;15 centimetres (3.1&ndash;5.9&nbsp;in) long and 3&ndash;5 centimetres (1.2&ndash;2.0&nbsp;in) wide.

It can be an invasive weed.<br /><br />Other common names include <strong>may</strong>, <strong>mayblossom</strong>, <strong>maythorn</strong>, <strong>quickthorn</strong>, <strong>whitethorn</strong>, <strong>motherdie</strong>, and <strong>haw</strong>. This species is one of several that have been referred to as <em>Crataegus oxyacantha</em>, a name that has been rejected by the botanical community as too ambiguous.<br /><br />The common hawthorn is a shrub or small tree 5&ndash;14 metres (15 to 45 feet) tall, with a dense crown. The bark is dull brown with vertical orange cracks. The younger stems bear sharp thorns, approximately 12.5mm (half an inch) long. The leaves are 20 to 40mm (1 to 1&frac12; inches) long, obovate and deeply lobed, sometimes almost to the midrib, with the lobes spreading at a wide angle. The upper surface is dark green above and paler underneath.<br /><br />The hermaphrodite flowers are produced in late spring (May to early June in its native area) in corymbs of 5-25 together; each flower is about 10mm diameter, and has five white petals, numerous red stamens, and a single style; they are moderately fragrant. The flowers are pollinated by midges, bees and other insects and later in the year bear numerous <em>haws</em>. The haw is a small, oval dark red fruit about 10mm long, berry-like, but structurally a pome containing a single seed. Haws are important for wildlife in winter, particularly thrushes and waxwings; these birds eat the haws and disperse the seeds in their droppings.<br /><br />The common hawthorn is distinguished from the related but less widespread Midland hawthorn (<em>C. laevigata</em>) by its more upright growth, the leaves being deeply lobed, with spreading lobes, and in the flowers having just one style, not two or three. However they are inter-fertile and hybrids occur frequently; they are only entirely distinct in their more typical forms.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Aphanes arvensis</strong></em>, known as <strong>parsley-piert</strong>, is a sprawling, downy plant common all over the British Isles where It grows on arable fields and bare wastelands, particularly in dry sites. The short-stalked leaves have three segments each lobed at the tip. Flowers April&ndash;September. The tiny green flower has four sepals and no petals, the fruit is oval pointed. Stipules form a leaf-like cup, enclosing the flower. The name of parsley piert has nothing to do with parsley. It is a corruption of the French <em>perce-pierre</em>, meaning 'stone-piercer' and was given to the plant because of its habit of growing in shallow, stony soil and emerging between stones. As in the case of saxifrage (from the Latin meaning 'stone-breaker') it was wrongly assumed that the plant could pierce stones; and it was thought that a medicine made of parsley piert would break up stones in the bladder and kidneys. Old folk-names for the plant include 'colicwort' and 'bowel-hive-grass' (hive meant inflammation), showing that it was also used for intestinal ailments.<br /><br />The 17th-century herbalist Nicholas Culpeper, recommended parsley piert for use in salads, although it would be difficult to gather sufficient quantities of such a tiny plant for a reasonable meal. Culpeper also recommends the plant to gentlemen for eating as a winter pickle in addition to the pickled samphire to which they were accustomed.<br /><br />The genus name of <em>Aphanes</em> comes from a Greek word meaning unseen or unnoticed, which precisely describes this tiny plant.

It is widely cultivated for its edible pods, and as an ornamental tree in gardens. The ripe, dried pod is often ground to carob powder, which is used to replace cocoa powder. Carob bars, an alternative to chocolate bars, are often available in health-food stores.<br /><br />The carob tree is native to the Mediterranean region, including Southern Europe, Northern Africa, the larger Mediterranean islands, the Levant and Middle-East of Western Asia into Iran; and the Canary Islands and Macaronesia.<sup>[]</sup> The carat, a unit of mass for gemstones, and of purity for gold, takes its name, indirectly, from the Arabic word for a carob seed, <em>carrat</em>.<br /><br />The <em>Ceratonia siliqua</em> tree grows up to 15&nbsp;m (49&nbsp;ft) tall. The crown is broad and semispherical, supported by a thick trunk with brown rough bark and sturdy branches. Leaves are 10 to 20&nbsp;cm (3.9 to 7.9&nbsp;in) long, alternate, pinnate, and may or may not have a terminal leaflet. It is frost-tolerant to roughly 20&nbsp;&deg;F (&minus;7&nbsp;&deg;C).<br /><br />Most carob trees are dioecious, some are hermaphrodite. The male trees do not produce fruit. The trees blossom in autumn. The flowers are small and numerous, spirally arranged along the inflorescence axis in catkin-like racemes borne on spurs from old wood and even on the trunk (cauliflory); they are pollinated by both wind and insects.<br /><br />The fruit is a legume (also known less accurately as a pod), that can be elongated, compressed, straight, or curved, and thickened at the sutures. The pods take a full year to develop and ripen. The sweet ripe pods eventually fall to the ground and are eaten by various mammals, such as swine, thereby dispersing the hard seed. The seeds contain leucodelphinidin, a colourless chemical compound.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>pea</strong> is most commonly the small spherical seed or the seed-pod of the pod fruit <em><strong>Pisum sativum</strong></em>. Each pod contains several peas. Pea pods are botanically fruit, since they contain seeds and developed from the ovary of a (pea) flower. The name is also used to describe other edible seeds from the Fabaceae such as the pigeon pea (<em>Cajanus cajan</em>), the cowpea (<em>Vigna unguiculata</em>), and the seeds from several species of <em>Lathyrus</em>.<br /><br /><em>P. sativum</em> is an annual plant, with a life cycle of one year. It is a cool-season crop grown in many parts of the world; planting can take place from winter to early summer depending on location. The average pea weighs between 0.1 and 0.36&nbsp;grams. The immature peas (and in snow peas the tender pod as well) are used as a vegetable, fresh, frozen or canned; varieties of the species typically called field peas are grown to produce dry peas like the split pea shelled from the matured pod. These are the basis of pease porridge and pea soup, staples of medieval cuisine; in Europe, consuming fresh immature green peas was an innovation of Early Modern cuisine.<br /><br />The wild pea is restricted to the Mediterranean basin and the Near East. The earliest archaeological finds of peas date from the late neolithic era of current Greece, Syria, Turkey and Jordan. In Egypt, early finds date from <em>ca.</em> 4800&ndash;4400&nbsp;BC in the Nile delta area, and from <em>ca.</em> 3800&ndash;3600&nbsp;BC in Upper Egypt. The pea was also present in Georgia in the 5th millennium BC. Farther east, the finds are younger. Peas were present in Afghanistan <em>ca.</em> 2000&nbsp;BC, in Harappa, Pakistan, and in northwest India in 2250&ndash;1750&nbsp;BC. In the second half of the 2nd millennium BC, this pulse crop appears in the Ganges Basin and southern India.<br /><br />A pea is a most commonly green, occasionally golden yellow, or infrequently purple pod-shaped vegetable, widely grown as a cool season vegetable crop. The seeds may be planted as soon as the soil temperature reaches 10&nbsp;&deg;C (50&nbsp;&deg;F), with the plants growing best at temperatures of 13 to 18&nbsp;&deg;C (55 to 64&nbsp;&deg;F). They do not thrive in the summer heat of warmer temperate and lowland tropical climates, but do grow well in cooler, high altitude, tropical areas. Many cultivars reach maturity about 60 days after planting.<br /><br />Peas have both low-growing and vining cultivars. The vining cultivars grow thin tendrils from leaves that coil around any available support and can climb to be 1&ndash;2&nbsp;m high. A traditional approach to supporting climbing peas is to thrust branches pruned from trees or other woody plants upright into the soil, providing a lattice for the peas to climb. Branches used in this fashion are sometimes called <strong>pea brush</strong>. Metal fences, twine, or netting supported by a frame are used for the same purpose. In dense plantings, peas give each other some measure of mutual support. Pea plants can self-pollinate<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Besides the English names, other common names include: <em>gavdaneh</em> (Persian), <em>kersannah</em> (Arabic), <em>yero</em> (Spanish), <em>rovi</em> (Greek), and <em>bur&ccedil;ak</em> (Turkish). The nutritional value of the grain for ruminant cattle has guaranteed the continued cultivation of <em>V. ervilia</em> in Morocco, Spain and Turkey. The crop is easy to cultivate and harvest and can be grown on very shallow, alkaline soils.<br /><br />The grain when split resembles red lentils. For human consumption the bitterness of the seeds needs to be removed through leaching by several changes of boiling water. Owing to this bitterness, it is unlikely that someone would accidentally confuse bitter vetch with red lentils. According to Zohary and Hopf, only humans of the poorest economic classes consume this crop, or in times of famine; however, Pliny the Elder states that bitter vetch (<em>ervum</em>) has medicinal value like vetch (<em>vicia</em>), citing the letters of Augustus where the emperor wrote that he regained his health from a diet of bitter vetch.<br /><br />The grain is an excellent sheep and cattle feed concentrate. It has been held in high esteem by farmers in the Old World since the beginning of agriculture to improve the nutritional value of bulk feeds.<br /><br />The wild strains of bitter vetch are limited to an area that includes Anatolia and northern Iraq, with an extension south along the Anti-Lebanon Mountains of Syria and Lebanon. Traces of the earliest domesticated instances were recovered from several archeological sites in Turkey, which have an uncorrected radiocarbon dating of the 7th and 6th millennia BC.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a legume, grown as a forage crop, fodder crop, cover crop, and green manure. Although non-native, it occurs in all US states and is considered invasive by some states, such as Alaska, Florida, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Oregon, and Washington state &mdash; as well as in Japan and some parts of Europe where it is not native. It is also found in most Canadian provinces.<br /><br />Hairy vetch is very similar to tufted vetch (<em>Vicia cracca</em>), the most noticeable difference being that tufted vetch has a smooth stem.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to southern Europe, North Africa, and nearby islands, and it is utilized elsewhere in agriculture and may be present in the wild as an introduced species. It is an annual herb with a climbing stem which is coated in hairs, often densely, making the plant appear silvery white. Each leaf is made up of several pairs of elongated leaflets which measure up to 3 centimeters in length. The inflorescence is a one-side raceme of several dark reddish purple flowers. Each flower has a densely hairy calyx of sepals and a tubular corolla between one and two centimeters in length. The fruit is a flat, hairy legume pod up to 3.5 centimeters long containing multiple seeds.<br /><br />This plant is used as a cover crop and green manure for the purposes of soil improvement and weed and pest control. It is used in crop rotation, for hay and fodder, and as a honey plant, and it has a very high biomass yield.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to North Africa southwest and south Asia, and extensively cultivated elsewhere. A variety <em>Vicia faba</em> var. <em>equina</em><small>Pers.</small>&nbsp;&ndash; <strong>horse bean</strong> has been previously recognized.<br /><br />It is a stiffly erect plant 0.5&ndash;1.8 m tall, with stout stems of a square cross-section. The leaves are 10&ndash;25&nbsp;cm long, pinnate with 2&ndash;7 leaflets, and of a distinct glaucous grey-green color. Unlike most other vetches, the leaves do not have tendrils for climbing over other vegetation. The flowers are 1&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm long, with five petals, the standard petal white, the wing petals white with a black spot (true black, not deep purple or blue as is the case in many 'black' colorings,) and the keel petals are white. Crimson-flowered broad beans also exist, which were recently saved from extinction.<sup>[2]</sup> The flowers have a strong and sweet scent which is attractive to bees and other pollinators.<sup>[3]</sup> The fruit is a broad, leathery pod, green maturing to blackish-brown, with a densely downy surface; in the wild species, the pods are 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm long and 1&nbsp;cm diameter, but many modern cultivars developed for food use have pods 15&ndash;25&nbsp;cm long and 2&ndash;3&nbsp;cm thick. Each pod contains 3&ndash;8 seeds, round to oval and 5&ndash;10&nbsp;mm diameter in the wild plant, usually flattened and up to 20&ndash;25&nbsp;mm long, 15&nbsp;mm broad and 5&ndash;10&nbsp;mm thick in food cultivars. <em>Vicia faba</em> has a diploid (2n) chromosome number of 12 (six homologous pairs).

The plant's name comes from its underground seed development (geocarpy), a characteristic not possessed by other clovers.<br /><br />It can thrive in poor-quality soil where other clovers cannot survive, and is grown commercially for animal fodder. There are three distinct subspecies used in agriculture, each with its own ideal climate and soil type, allowing for wide distribution of the plant over varied environments.<ul><li><em>T. subterraneum</em> subsp. <em>subterraneum</em> is the generalist subspecies, and it can be grown in the widest range of environments.</li><li><em>T. subterraneum</em> subsp. <em>yanninicum</em> is grown in moist areas that are prone to flooding.</li><li><em>T. subterraneum</em> subsp. <em>brachycalycinum</em> is a more sensitive plant, requiring dry, cracked soil for its germination.</li></ul>Some systematists consider the three plants to be separate species. There are many strains and varieties of these subspecies, but few are in wide use. The technique of mixing the subspecies in one field is popular as a method of ensuring a dense crop. Also, subterranean clover is sometimes mixed with alfalfa for a longer-lasting grazing pasture.<br /><br />This species is self-fertilizing, unlike most legume forage crops such as alfalfa and other clovers, which are pollinated by insects, especially honeybees. The flowers of subclover are often located beneath its leaves and are low in nectar, making access both difficult and unappealing for bees. These characteristics also make the plant less attractive to certain types of pest insects.<br /><br />Subterranean clover is one of the most commonly grown forage crops in Australia.<sup>[2]</sup> It is also grown in places such as California and Texas, where the extreme ranges of soil type and quality, rainfall, and temperature make the variable tolerances of sub clover especially useful.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

They are small annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial herbaceous plants. Clover can be evergreen. The leaves are trifoliate (rarely quatrefoiled (Four-leaf clover), cinquefoil, or septfoil), with stipules adnate to the leaf-stalk, and heads or dense spikes of small red, purple, white, or yellow flowers; the small, few-seeded pods are enclosed in the calyx.

			"Description": "<em><strong>Trifolium fragiferum</strong></em>, the <strong>strawberry clover</strong>, is a herbaceous perennial plant species in the bean family Fabaceae. It is native to Europe, Asia, and parts of Africa. It is present in other places, such as sections of North America, as an introduced species. It is also cultivated as a cover crop and for hay and silage, as green manure, and as a bee plant.<br /><br />This is a perennial herb that spreads via stolons to form mats or clumps of herbage. The leaves are compound, each with three serrated oval leaflets up to 2 to 2.5 centimeters long. The inflorescence is a head of flowers around a centimeter long when first flowering. It increases in size to two centimeters as the fruits develop, the sepals becoming thin and inflated, fuzzy and pinkish in color, to resemble a strawberry or raspberry.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Trifolium repens</strong></em>, the <strong>white clover</strong> (also known as <strong>Dutch clover</strong>, <strong>Ladino clover</strong>, or <strong>Ladino</strong>), is a herbaceous perennial plant in the bean family Fabaceae (Previously referred to as Leguminosae). It is native to Europe and central Asia. One of the most widely cultivated types of clover, it has been widely introduced worldwide as a forage crop, and is now also common in most grassy areas (lawns and gardens) of North America and New Zealand. The species includes varieties often classed as small, intermediate and large, according to height, which reflects petiole length. The term &ldquo;white clover&rdquo; is applied to the species in general, &ldquo;Dutch clover&rdquo; is often applied to intermediate varieties (but sometimes to smaller varieties), and &ldquo;ladino clover&rdquo; is applied to large varieties.<br /><br />It is a herbaceous, perennial plant. It is low growing, with heads of whitish flowers, often with a tinge of pink or cream that may come on with the aging of the plant. The heads are generally 1.5&ndash;2 centimetres (0.6&ndash;0.8&nbsp;in) wide, and are at the end of 7-cm (2.8-in) peduncles or flower stalks. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees and often by honey bees. The leaves, are trifoliolate, smooth, elliptic to egg-shaped and long-petioled and usually with light or dark markings. The stems function as stolons, so white clover often forms mats, with the stems creeping as much as 18&nbsp;cm (7.1&nbsp;in) a year, and rooting at the nodes. The leaves form the symbol known as shamrock.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Lotus corniculatus</strong></em> is a common flowering plant in the pea family Fabaceae, native to grassland in temperate Eurasia and North Africa. Common names include <strong>common bird's-foot trefoil</strong> and just <strong>bird's-foot trefoil</strong>, though the common name is often also applied to other members of the genus. It is also known in cultivation in North America as <strong>bird's-foot deervetch</strong>.<br /><br />It is a perennial herbaceous plant, similar in appearance to some clovers. The flowers are mostly visited by bumblebees and develop into small pea-like pods or legumes. The name 'bird's foot' refers to the appearance of the seed pods on their stalk. Five leaflets are present, but with the central three held conspicuously above the others, hence the use of the name 'trefoil'. It is often used as forage and is widely used as food for livestock due to its nonbloating properties.<br /><br />The height of the plant is variable, from 5&ndash;20&nbsp;cm, occasionally more where supported by other plants; the stems can reach up to 50&nbsp;cm long. It is typically sprawling at the height of the surrounding grassland. It can survive fairly close grazing, trampling, and mowing. It is most often found in sandy soils. It flowers from June to September.<br /><br />The plant has had many common English names in Britain, which are now mostly out of use. These names were often connected with the yellow and orange colour of the flowers, e.g. 'butter and eggs'. One name that is still used is <strong>eggs and bacon</strong> (or <strong>bacon and eggs</strong>).<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The name lucerne is the more commonly used name in the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. The plant superficially resembles clover (a cousin in the same family), especially while young, when trifoliate leaves comprising round leaflets predominate. Later in maturity, leaflets are elongated. It has clusters of small purple flowers followed by fruits spiralled in 2 to 3 turns containing 10&ndash;20 seeds. Alfalfa is native to warmer temperate climates. It has been cultivated as livestock fodder since at least the era of the ancient Greeks and Romans. Alfalfa sprouts are a common ingredient in dishes made in South Indian cuisine.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Plants of the genus <em>Medicago</em>, or bur clovers, are closely related to the true clovers (<em>Trifolium</em>) and sweet clover (<em>Melilotus</em>). Like the true clovers, black medick has three leaflets and a small, yellow flower closely resembling those of the lesser trefoil. Black medick belongs to the same genus as alfalfa.<br /><br /><em>Medicago lupulina</em> is an annual or short-lived perennial plant, growing each year from adventitious buds on the roots. Mature plants measure from fifteen to eighty centimeters (32 inches) in height, with fine stems often lying flat at the beginning of growth and later erecting. The leaves are compound, each with three oval leaflets, carried on a short petiole; the center leaflet usually has a longer petiole. The leaflets are hairy, toothed toward the tip, and differ from those of the similar <em>Trifolium dubium</em> in that they end in a short point.<br /><br />Black medick has small yellow flowers, often grouped in tight bunches, and typically measuring between two and four millimeters in diameter; but on larger plants the flowers may reach eight millimeters or more (1/3 inch).<br /><br />The fruit is a small, ovoid pod, between one and two millimeters in length, that does not open upon maturation, but hardens and turns black when ripe. Each pod contains a single amber-colored seed.<br /><br />Like other legumes, the roots of black medick contain nodules hosting nitrogen-fixing bacteria. Plants that survive for more than one year may develop a deep tap root.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It forms a symbiotic relationship with the bacterium <em>Sinorhizobium medicae</em>, which is capable of nitrogen fixation. Common names include <strong>California burclover</strong>, <strong>toothed bur clover</strong>, <strong>toothed medick</strong> and <strong>burr medic</strong>.<br /><br />This weedy forb is an annual broadleaf plant. It inhabits agricultural land, roadsides and other disturbed areas. It is found in lawns as well, where its burrs are able to cling to the clothing or fur of any species that pass near it, thus facilitating geographic spread via these seed capsules. It makes a poor lawn in the late summer, when the leaves have yellowed and fruit sets into the 7&nbsp;mm seed heads that are covered with hooked prickles.<br /><br />Burclover is a good forage for livestock, but the fruit is prickly. All classes of livestock, except horses and mules, can feed its leaves.<br /><br />New seedlings have seed leaves that are oblong. The first true leaf is rounded. Later leaves will be tripartite, with a characteristic clover-like shape, appearing alternately on the stems. Leaflets have slightly serrated edges. The tiny yellow flowers attract small butterflies and other pollinating insects.<br /><br />Full grown plant stems are up to 2 feet (60&nbsp;cm) long, and usually sprawl along and/or under the ground. The stems often root at the nodes; adult plants, and even young plants that have been able to grow for a few weeks undisturbed can be very difficult to pull out, leaving behind tap roots and a network of plant pieces when pulled. Mechanically removing top growth from this plant will not usually eradicate it. If not properly managed, burclover may then become invasive and displace more desirable vegetation.<br /><br />Being a member of the Leguminosae family, the flowers are clover-like, lipped and clustered. Bloom takes place from March to June in the plant's native territory. Flowers (3&ndash;6&nbsp;mm long) are small, bright yellow, and cluster into flower heads of 2 to 10 flowers at the stem tips. The fruit is a pod that coils tightly 2 to 6 times and has rows of prickles on the outside edge of the pod. The fruits are about 6&ndash;7&nbsp;mm across. They start out green and relatively soft, but quickly turn brown and hard. Inside the pod are several seeds&mdash;usually yellow or tan and kidney shaped. The burred fruiting bodies can be quite difficult to remove from softer fabrics, such as fleeces and knitted socks.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to the Mediterranean Basin and was introduced to North America in the eighteenth century, where it has since become invasive, particularly of the deserts and arid grasslands of the southwestern United States.<br /><br />It is a hairy, sticky annual. The stems bear bright pink flowers, which often have dark spots on the bases. The flowers are arranged in a loose cluster and have ten filaments &ndash; five of which are fertile &ndash; and five styles. The leaves are pinnate to pinnate-pinnatifid, and the long seed-pod, shaped like the bill of a stork, bursts open in a spiral when ripe, sending the seeds (which have little feathery parachutes attached) into the air.<br /><br />Seed launch is accomplished using a spring mechanism powered by shape changes as the fruits dry. The spiral shape of the awn can unwind during daily changes in humidity, leading to self-burial of the seeds once they are on the ground. The two tasks (springy launch and self-burial) are accomplished with the same tissue (the awn), which is hygroscopically active and warps upon wetting and also gives rise to the draggy hairs on the awn.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Like most African <em>Oxalis</em> species, it produces adventitious subterranean propagules. These take the form of true bulbs in botanical terms, which is unusual among dicotyledons. In fact, <em>Oxalis pes-caprae</em> produces small bulbs copiously, whereas most other African species produce fewer, larger bulbs. New world <em>Oxalis</em>, such as <em>Oxalis corniculata</em>, apparently do not generally produce bulbs.<br /><br />Indigenous to South Africa, <em>Oxalis pes-caprae</em>, the 'Bermuda buttercup', is an invasive species and noxious weed in many other parts of the world, including the United States (particularly coastal California), Europe, Israel and Australia.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Ricinus communis</strong></em>, the <strong>castorbean</strong> or <strong>castor-oil-plant</strong>, is a species of perennial flowering plant in the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. It is the sole species in the monotypic genus, <em><strong>Ricinus</strong></em>, and subtribe, <strong>Ricininae</strong>. The evolution of castor and its relation to other species are currently being studied using modern genetic tools.<sup>[4]</sup> It reproduces with a mixed pollination system which favors selfing by geitonogamy but at the same time can be an out-crosser by anemophily (wind pollination) or entomophily (insect pollination).<br /><br />Its seed is the castor bean, which, despite its name, is not a true bean. Castor is indigenous to the southeastern Mediterranean Basin, Eastern Africa, and India, but is widespread throughout tropical regions (and widely grown elsewhere as an ornamental plant).<br /><br />Castor seed is the source of castor oil, which has a wide variety of uses. The seeds contain between 40% and 60% oil that is rich in triglycerides, mainly ricinolein. The seed also contains ricin, a water-soluble toxin, which is also present in lower concentrations throughout the plant.<br /><br /><em>Ricinus communis</em> can vary greatly in its growth habit and appearance. The variability has been increased by breeders who have selected a range of cultivars for leaf and flower colours, and for oil production. It is a fast-growing, suckering shrub that can reach the size of a small tree (around 12 metres or 39 feet), but it is not cold hardy.<br /><br />The glossy leaves are 15&ndash;45 centimetres (5.9&ndash;17.7&nbsp;in) long, long-stalked, alternate and palmate with 5&ndash;12 deep lobes with coarsely toothed segments. In some varieties they start off dark reddish purple or bronze when young, gradually changing to a dark green, sometimes with a reddish tinge, as they mature. The leaves of some other varieties are green practically from the start, whereas in yet others a pigment masks the green colour of all the chlorophyll-bearing parts, leaves, stems and young fruit, so that they remain a dramatic purple-to-reddish-brown throughout the life of the plant. Plants with the dark leaves can be found growing next to those with green leaves, so there is most likely only a single gene controlling the production of the pigment in some varieties. The stems (and the spherical, spiny seed capsules) also vary in pigmentation. The fruit capsules of some varieties are more showy than the flowers.<br /><br />The flowers are borne in terminal panicle-like inflorescences of green or, in some varieties, shades of red, monoecious flowers without petals. The male flowers are numerous, yellowish-green with prominent creamy stamens; the female flowers, borne at the tips of the spikes, lie within the immature spiny capsules, are relatively few in number and have prominent red stigmas.<br /><br />The fruit is a spiny, greenish (to reddish-purple) capsule containing large, oval, shiny, bean-like, highly poisonous seeds with variable brownish mottling. Castor seeds have a warty appendage called the caruncle, which is a type of elaiosome. The caruncle promotes the dispersal of the seed by ants (myrmecochory).<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Pistacia lentiscus</strong></em> (also <strong>lentisk</strong>; <strong>mastic</strong>; Greek: &mu;&alpha;&sigma;&tau;?&chi;&alpha; <em>mast&iacute;kha?</em>) is a dioecious evergreen shrub or small tree of the pistacio genus growing up to 4&nbsp;m (13&nbsp;ft) tall which is cultivated for its aromatic resin, mainly on the Greek island of Chios.<br /><br /><em>Pistacia lentiscus</em> is a shrub or dioecious tree, with separate male and female plants, evergreen from 1 to 5 m high, with a strong smell of resin, growing in dry and rocky areas in Mediterranean Europe. It resists heavy frosts and grows on all types of soils, and can grow well in limestone areas and even in salty or saline environments, making it more abundant near the sea. It is also found in woodlands, dehesas (almost deforested pasture areas), Kermes oak wood, oaks wood, garrigue, maquis, hills, gorges, canyons, and rocky hillsides of the entire Mediterranean area. It is a very typical species that grows in Mediterranean mixed communities of myrtle, Kermes oak, Mediterranean dwarf palm, buckthorn, sarsaparilla, etc. and serves as protection and food for birds and other fauna in this ecosystem. It is a very hardy pioneer species dispersed by birds. When older, it develops some large trunks and numerous thicker and longer branches. In appropriate areas, when allowed to grow freely and age, it often becomes a tree of up to 7 m. However, logging, grazing, and fires often prevent its development.<br /><br />The leaves are alternate, leathery, and compound paripinnate (no terminal leaflet) with five or six pairs of deep-green leaflets. It presents very small flowers, the male with five stamens, the female trifid style. The fruit is a drupe, first red and then black when ripe, about 4&nbsp;mm in diameter.<br /><br />In tourist areas, with palmitos or Mediterranean dwarf palm, and exotic plants, it is often chosen to repopulate gardens and resorts, because of its strength and attractive appearance. Unlike other species of <em>Pistacia</em>, it retains its leaves throughout the year. It has been introduced as an ornamental shrub in Mexico, where it has naturalized and is often seen primarily in suburban and semiarid areas where the summer rainfall climate, contrary to the Mediterranean, does not hurt it.<br /><br />A related species, <em>P. saportae</em>, has been shown by DNA analysis to be a hybrid between maternal <em>P. lentiscus</em> and paternal <em>P. terebinthus</em> (terebinth or turpentine). The hybrid has imparipinnate leaves, with leaflets semipersistent, subsessile terminal, and sometimes reduced. Usually, <em>P. terebinthus</em> and <em>P. lentiscus</em> occupy different biotopes and barely overlap: Mastic appears at lower elevations and near the sea, while the <em>P. terebinthus</em> most frequently inhabits inland and mountainous areas such as the Iberian System.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

In the eastern shores of the Mediterranean sea&nbsp;&ndash; Syria, Lebanon&nbsp;&ndash; a similar species, <em>Pistacia palaestina</em>, fills the same ecological niche as this species and is also known as terebinth.<br /><br />It is a species of flowering plant belonging to the family Anacardiaceae (the cashew family). It is a small deciduous tree or large shrub growing to 10 m tall. The leaves are compound, 10&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long, odd pinnate with five to eleven opposite glossy oval leaflets, the leaflets 2&ndash;6&nbsp;cm long and 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm broad. The flowers are reddish-purple, appearing with the new leaves in early spring. The fruit consists of small, globular drupes 5&ndash;7&nbsp;mm long, red to black when ripe. All parts of the plant have a strong resinous smell.<br /><br />It is a dioecious tree, i.e. exists as male and female specimens. For a viable population both genders must be present. The oblong leaf is bright green, leathery, with 10&nbsp;cm long or more with 3-9 leaflets. Leaves alternate, leathery and compound paripinnate (no terminal leaflet) with 3 or 6 deep green leaflets. They are generally larger and rounder than the leaves of the mastic, reminiscent of the leaves of carob tree. The flowers range from purple to green, the fruit is the size of a pea and turns from red to brown, depending on the degree of maturation. The whole plant emits a strong smell: bitter, resinous or medicinal. In the vegetative period they develop 'galls' in a goat's horn shaped (from which the plant gets the name cornicabra, the common name in Spanish), that occur on the leaves and leaflets which have been bitten by insects. The species propagates by seeds and shoots. Although marred by the presence of galls, is a very strong and resistant tree which survives in degraded areas where other species have been eliminated. Pistacia terebinthus is a plant related to <em>Pistacia lentiscus</em>, with which hybridizes frequently in contact zones. The cornicabra is more abundant in the mountains and inland and the mastic is usually found more frequently in areas where the Mediterranean influence of the sea moderates the climate. Mastic tree does not reach the size of the Pistacia terebinthus, but the hybrids are very difficult to distinguish. The mastic has winged stalks to its leaflets, i.e., they are flattened and side fins, whereas these stems in Cornicabra are simple. In the Eastern Mediterranean Coast, Syria, Lebanon, a similar species, <em>Pistacia palaestina</em>, fills the same ecological niche of this species and is also known as turpentine. On the west coast of the Mediterranean, Canary Islands and Middle East, <em>Pistacia terebinthus</em> can be confused with <em>Pistacia atlantica</em>.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a evergreen tree or shrub found, for example, in shady areas of forests of oak and in beech hedges. It has a great capacity to adapt to different conditions and is a pioneer species that repopulates the margins of forests or clearcuts.<br /><br />As a tree, Christmas holly can exceed 10 m in height. It is usually found as a shrub or a small tree about 1 m tall with a straight trunk and pyramidal crown, which branches from the base. It grows slowly and does not usually fully mature due to grazing, cutting, or fire.

In the young and in the lower limbs of mature trees, the leaves have three to five sharp spines on each side, pointing alternately upward and downward, while leaves of the upper branches in mature trees lack spines.<br /><br />The flowers are white, four-lobed, and pollinated by bees. Holly is dioecious, meaning that there are male plants and female plants. The sex cannot be determined until the plants begin flowering, usually between 4 and 12 years of age. In male specimens, the flowers are yellowish and appear in axillary groups. In the female, flowers are isolated or in groups of three and are small and white or slightly pink, and consist of four petals and four sepals partially fused at the base.<br /><br />The fruit is a red drupe, about 6&ndash;10&nbsp;mm in diameter, a bright red or bright yellow, which matures around October or November; at this time they are very bitter due to the ilicin content and so are rarely eaten until late winter after frost has made them softer and more palatable. They are eaten by rodents, birds and larger herbivores. Each fruit contains 3 to 4 seeds which do not germinate until the second or third spring. The fruit only appears on female plants, which require male plants nearby to fertilise them.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

There are currently between 5,000 and 10,000 varieties of <em>Vitis vinifera</em> grapes though only a few are of commercial significance for wine and table grape production.<br /><br />It is a liana growing to 35 yards (32&nbsp;m) in length, with flaky bark. The leaves are alternate, palmately lobed, 5&ndash;20&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;7.9&nbsp;in) long and broad. The fruit is a berry, known as a grape; in the wild species it is 6&nbsp;mm (0.24&nbsp;in) diameter and ripens dark purple to blackish with a pale wax bloom; in cultivated plants it is usually much larger, up to 3&nbsp;cm (1.2&nbsp;in) long, and can be green, red, or purple (black). The species typically occurs in humid forests and streamsides.<br /><br />The wild grape is often classified as <em>V. vinifera</em> subsp. <em>sylvestris</em> (in some classifications considered <em>Vitis sylvestris</em>), with <em>V. vinifera</em> subsp. <em>vinifera</em> restricted to cultivated forms. Domesticated vines have hermaphrodite flowers, but subsp. <em>sylvestris</em> is dioecious (male and female flowers on separate plants) and pollination is required for fruit to develop.<br /><br />The grape is eaten fresh, processed to make wine or juice, or dried to produce raisins. Cultivars of <em>Vitis vinifera</em> form the basis of the majority of wines produced around the world. All of the familiar wine varieties belong to <em>Vitis vinifera</em>, which is cultivated on every continent except for Antarctica, and in all the major wine regions of the world.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Therefore, <em>Hypericum perforatum</em> is sometimes called 'common St John's wort' or 'perforate St John's wort' in order to differentiate it. It is a medicinal herb with antidepressant activity and anti-inflammatory properties as an arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor and COX-1 inhibitor.<br /><br /><em>Hypericum perforatum</em> is native to parts of Europe and Asia but has spread to temperate regions worldwide as a cosmopolitan invasive weed.<br /><br />The common name 'St John's wort' comes from its traditional flowering and harvesting on St John's Day, 24 June. The genus name <em>Hypericum</em> is derived from the Greek words <em>hyper</em> (above) and <em>eikon</em> (picture), in reference to the tradition of hanging plants over religious icons in the home during St John's Day, to ward off evil.<br /><br />Perforate St John's wort is a herbaceous perennial plant with extensive, creeping rhizomes. Its stems are erect, branched in the upper section, and can grow to 1 m high. It has opposite, stalkless, narrow, oblong leaves that are 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm long. The leaves are yellow-green in color, with scattered translucent dots of glandular tissue. The dots are conspicuous when held up to the light, giving the leaves the 'perforated' appearance to which the plant's Latin name refers. The flowers measure up to 2.5&nbsp;cm across, have five petals, and are colored bright yellow with conspicuous black dots. The flowers appear in broad cymes at the ends of the upper branches, between late spring and early to mid summer. The sepals are pointed, with black glandular dots. There are many stamens, which are united at the base into three bundles. The pollen grains are ellipsoidal.<br /><br />When flower buds (not the flowers themselves) or seed pods are crushed, a reddish/purple liquid is produced.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

In the flower centre is a tight cluster of orange stamens, which are sensitive to the touch, and spread outwards to reveal the tall stigma in the middle. The plant is common on chalk downs, and occasional in other grasslands, always on dry, base-rich soil. The wild species has yellow flowers, but garden varieties range from white through yellow to deep red.<br /><br />Though the individual blooms are short-lived, the plant produces a mass of flowers through the summer. It needs a dry, sunny place, like a south-facing rockery or meadow. As the Latin name <em>Helianthemum</em> suggests, these are sun-flowers. This is a good nectar source for bees and there are several species of small beetle that feed on the foliage. Common rock-rose is also the food plant for the larvae of several species of moth and butterfly.<br /><br />It flowers from May until July.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is present in many other areas as an invasive introduced species, often becoming a noxious weed. It was first described for botanical classification by the taxonomist Carolus Linnaeus in 1753, but had already been in cultivation since 1596.<br /><br />It has fragile, woody branchlets that drop off in autumn along with the small, scale-like leaves that cover them. The leaf-shape is an adaption over time to exceedingly dry conditions.<br /><br />The pink flowers are tiny, hermaphroditic, and are borne on narrow, feather-like spikes. They frequently bloom earlier than the leaves, first in May, and sometimes a second time in August.<br /><br />In its native range the plant grows in moist areas such as riverbanks, especially in saline soils. It has been grown as an ornamental plant for its profuse production of showy pink flower spikes. In Algeria and surrounding areas it has been used medicinally for rheumatism, diarrhea, and other maladies.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The genus <em><strong>Tamarix</strong></em> (<strong>tamarisk</strong>, <strong>salt cedar</strong>) is composed of about 50&ndash;60 species of flowering plants in the family Tamaricaceae, native to drier areas of Eurasia and Africa. The generic name originated in Latin and may refer to the Tamaris River in Hispania Tarraconensis (Spain).<br /><br />They are evergreen or deciduous shrubs or trees growing to 1&ndash;18 m in height and forming dense thickets. The largest, <em>Tamarix aphylla</em>, is an evergreen tree that can grow to 18 m tall. They usually grow on saline soils, tolerating up to 15,000 ppm soluble salt and can also tolerate alkaline conditions.<br /><br />Tamarisks are characterized by slender branches and grey-green foliage. The bark of young branches is smooth and reddish brown. As the plants age, the bark becomes bluish-purple, ridged and furrowed.<br /><br />The leaves are scale-like, almost like that of junipers 1&ndash;2&nbsp;mm long, and overlap each other along the stem. They are often encrusted with salt secretions.<br /><br />The pink to white flowers appear in dense masses on 5&ndash;10&nbsp;cm long spikes at branch tips from March to September, though some species (e.g. <em>T. aphylla</em>) tend to flower during the winter.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Opuntia ficus-indica</strong></em> is a species of cactus that has long been a domesticated crop plant important in agricultural economies throughout arid and semiarid parts of the world. It is thought probably to have originated in Mexico. Some of the common English names for the plant and its fruit are <strong>Indian fig opuntia</strong>, <strong>Barbary fig</strong>, <strong>cactus pear</strong>, <strong>spineless cactus</strong>, and <strong>prickly pear</strong>, although this last name has also been applied to other less common <em>Opuntia</em> species. In Mexican Spanish, the plant is called <em><strong>nopal</strong></em>, while the fruit is called <em><strong>tuna</strong></em>, which are names also used in American English, especially as culinary terms.<br /><br />Fig opuntia is grown primarily as a fruit crop, and also for the vegetable nopales and other uses. Most culinary references to the 'prickly pear' are referring to this species. The name 'tuna' is also used for the fruit of this cactus, and for <em>Opuntia</em> in general; according to Alexander von Humboldt, it was a word of Taino origin taken into the Spanish language around 1500.<br /><br />Cacti are good crops for dry areas because they efficiently convert water into biomass. <em>O. ficus-indica</em>, as the most widespread of the long-domesticated cactuses, is as economically important as maize and blue agave in Mexico today. Because <em>Opuntia</em> species hybridize easily (much like oaks), the wild origin of <em>O. ficus-indica</em> is likely to have been in Mexico due to the fact that its close genetic relatives are found in central Mexico.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

They typically grow from 30&ndash;55&nbsp;m (98&ndash;180&nbsp;ft) tall. The tallest currently known specimen in Tasmania is 90.7&nbsp;m (298&nbsp;ft) tall. There are historical claims of even taller trees, the tallest being 101&nbsp;m (331&nbsp;ft). The natural distribution of the species includes Tasmania and southern Victoria (particularly the Otway Ranges and southern Gippsland). There are also isolated occurrences on King Island and Flinders Island in Bass Strait and on the summit of the You Yangs near Geelong. There are naturalised non-native occurrences in Spain and Portugal, and other parts of southern Europe incl. Cyprus, southern Africa, New Zealand, western United States (California), Hawaii, Macaronesia, and the Caucasus (Western Georgia).<br /><br />The d'Entrecasteaux expedition made immediate use of the species when they discovered it, the timber being used to improve their oared boats. The Tasmanian blue gum was proclaimed as the floral emblem of Tasmania on 27 November 1962. The species name is from the Latin <em>globulus</em>, a little button, referring to the shape of the operculum.<br /><br />The bark sheds often, peeling in large strips. The broad juvenile leaves are borne in opposite pairs on square stems. They are about 6 to 15&nbsp;cm long and covered with a blue-grey, waxy bloom, which is the origin of the common name 'blue gum'. The mature leaves are narrow, sickle-shaped and dark shining green. They are arranged alternately on rounded stems and range from 15&ndash;35&nbsp;cm (5.9&ndash;13.8&nbsp;in) in length. The buds are top-shaped, ribbed and warty and have a flattened operculum (cap on the flower bud) bearing a central knob. The cream-coloured flowers are borne singly in the leaf axils and produce copious nectar that yields a strongly flavoured honey. The fruits are woody and range from 1.5&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (0.59&ndash;0.98&nbsp;in) in diameter. Numerous small seeds are shed through valves (numbering between 3 and 6 per fruit) which open on the top of the fruit. It produces roots throughout the soil profile, rooting several feet deep in some soils.<br /><br />The plant was first described by the French botanist Jacques Labillardi&egrave;re in his publications <em>Relation du Voyage &agrave; la Recherche de la P&eacute;rouse</em> (1800) and <em>Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen</em> (1804). The author collected specimens at Recherche Bay during the d'Entrecasteaux expedition in 1792<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

As intact arils or juice, pomegranates are used in baking, cooking, juice blends, meal garnishes, smoothies, and alcoholic beverages, such as cocktails and wine.<br /><br />The pomegranate originated in the region extending from modern-day Iran to northern India, and has been cultivated since ancient times throughout the Mediterranean region. It was introduced into Spanish America in the late 16th century and into California by Spanish settlers in 1769. Today, it is widely cultivated throughout the Middle East and Caucasus region, north and tropical Africa, the Indian subcontinent, Central Asia, the drier parts of southeast Asia, and parts of the Mediterranean Basin. It is also cultivated in parts of Arizona and California. In the 20th and 21st centuries, it became more common in the commercial markets of Europe and the Western Hemisphere.<br /><br />A shrub or small tree growing 6 to 10&nbsp;m (20 to 33&nbsp;ft) high, the pomegranate has multiple spiny branches and is extremely long-lived, with some specimens in France surviving for 200 years. <em>P. granatum</em> leaves are opposite or subopposite, glossy, narrow oblong, entire, 3&ndash;7&nbsp;cm (1.2&ndash;2.8&nbsp;in) long and 2&nbsp;cm broad. The flowers are bright red and 3&nbsp;cm in diameter, with three to seven petals. Some fruitless varieties are grown for the flowers alone.<br /><br />The edible fruit is a berry, intermediate in size between a lemon and a grapefruit, 5&ndash;12&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;4.7&nbsp;in) in diameter with a rounded shape and thick, reddish skin. The number of seeds in a pomegranate can vary from 200 to about 1400. Each seed has a surrounding water-laden pulp &mdash; the edible sarcotesta that forms from the seed coat &mdash; ranging in color from white to deep red or purple. The seeds are 'exarillate', i.e., unlike some other species in the order, <em>Myrtales</em>, no aril is present. The sarcotesta of pomegranate seeds consists of epidermis cells derived from the integument. The seeds are embedded in a white, spongy, astringent membrane. Pomegranate juice, obtained by compressing the seeds, causes a deep red stain which is difficult to remove. The pigmentation of pomegranate juice results from the presence of anthocyanins and ellagitannins.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It closely resembles another native milfoil, called northern water milfoil (<em>M. sibiricum</em>) Whorled water milfoil is also easily confused with four types of invasive milfoils: Eurasian water milfoil (<em>M. spicatum</em>), Variable water-milfoil (<em>M. heterophyllum</em>), Parrot feather (<em>M. aquaticum</em>), and hybrid water milfoil (<em>M. heterophyllum X M. laxum</em>).<br /><br />In many areas it is an invasive aquatic plant.<br /><br />With the increase in water sports, the spread of many water milfoils (Haloragaceae) has increased over the years. The spread of a milfoil is not only within one area, sometimes it spreads from one area to another many miles away.<br /><br />To the untrained eye, whorled water milfoil can look similar to other species.<br /><br />The best way to identify whorled water milfoil (<em>M. verticillatum</em>) is by looking at its two different types of leaves. The first type is the submersed leave, which looks feathery and contain about 5 to 14 leaflet pairs per leaf. The whorls along the stem contain about 4 to 5 leaves, which are spaced about 1&nbsp;cm apart. The other type is known as the emergent leaves. These leaves occur on the emergent spike and are pinnately lobed. From June till September whorled water milfoil produces flowers and fruits above or at the water's surface on erect spikes along the emergent leaves. The emergent leaves are typically two or more times longer than the flowers and fruits.<br /><br />Another way to distinguish whorled water milfoil is to look for turions, winter buds that appear toward the end of its growing season. This milfoil is one of a few that produce turions. This characteristic can also rule out other types of water milfoil that lack turions such as Eurasian water milfoil, parrot feather, hybrid water milfoil, and low water milfoil. The turions of this milfoil look like long yellowish-green club-shaped buds with small stiff leaves attached to the submerged stem. In the spring after dormancy the small, thick, dark green turions expand and grow from the stem. As the plant develops roots and continues to grow, the larger green summer leaves are produced at the tip of the plant. Turion leaves can be seen at the base of the plant sometimes into July. In fall the turions, with some other plant material, often break away from the majority of the rooted plant and float to new areas. Those fragments can be found washing up along shorelines in late fall. The stems of the whorled water milfoil form into mats from branched and unbranched stems that grow to be 20 to 100&nbsp;inches long.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The submerged leaves (usually between 15&ndash;35 mm long) are borne in pinnate whorls of four, with numerous thread-like leaflets roughly 4&ndash;13&nbsp;mm long. Plants are monoecious with flowers produced in the leaf axils (male above, female below) on a spike 5&ndash;15&nbsp;cm long held vertically above the water surface, each flower inconspicuous, orange-red, 4&ndash;6&nbsp;mm long. Eurasian water milfoil has 12- 21 pairs of leaflets while northern watermilfoil <em>M. sibiricum</em> only has 5&ndash;9 pairs.

It climbs by means of aerial rootlets with matted pads which cling strongly to the substrate. The ability to climb on surfaces varies with the plants variety and other factors: Hedera helix prefers non-reflective, darker and rough surfaces with near-neutral pH. It generally thrives in a wide range of soil pH with 6.5 being ideal, prefers moist, shady locations and avoids exposure to direct sunlight, the latter promoting drying out in winter.<sup>[4]</sup><br /><br />The leaves are alternate, 50&ndash;100&nbsp;mm (2&ndash;4&nbsp;in) long, with a 15&ndash;20&nbsp;mm (0.6&ndash;0.8&nbsp;in) petiole; they are of two types, with palmately five-lobed juvenile leaves on creeping and climbing stems, and unlobed cordate adult leaves on fertile flowering stems exposed to full sun, usually high in the crowns of trees or the top of rock faces.<br /><br />The flowers are produced from late summer until late autumn, individually small, in 3-to-5&nbsp;cm-diameter (1.2-to-2.0&nbsp;in) umbels, greenish-yellow, and very rich in nectar, an important late autumn food source for bees and other insects.<br /><br />The fruit are purple-black to orange-yellow berries 6&ndash;8&nbsp;mm (0.2&ndash;0.3&nbsp;in) in diameter, ripening in late winter,<sup>[5]</sup> and are an important food for many birds, though somewhat poisonous to humans.<br /><br />One to five seeds are in each berry, which are dispersed after being eaten by birds.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Thapsia villosa</strong></em>, commonly known as the <strong>villous deadly carrot</strong>, is a species of poisonous herbaceous plants in the genus <em>Thapsia</em>. It grows to about 70 to 190&nbsp;cm (28 to 75&nbsp;in) in height. It has pinnate hairy leaves with sheath-like petioles. The flowers are yellow in color and borne on compound umbels. They develop into fruits with four wings characteristic of the genus. It is native to southwestern Europe and northwestern Africa surrounding the Mediterranean Sea. The plant was used extensively for traditional medicine since around the 3rd century BC.<br /><br /><em>Thapsia villosa</em> is a perennial herb growing to a height of 70 to 190&nbsp;cm (28 to 75&nbsp;in). It has a robust and smooth tapering stem about 5 to 25&nbsp;mm (0.20 to 0.98&nbsp;in) in diameter, arising from a thick root resembling a white carrot or turnip.<br /><br />The leaves, like the name of the species suggests, are hairy. The leaves around the base of the stem have well-developed sheath-like petioles about 20 to 80&nbsp;mm (0.79 to 3.15&nbsp;in) wide. Like the leaves, they are also hairy. They are whitish, yellowish, green, or (rarely) purple in color. The leaf blades are triangular to deltoid in shape and are pinnate, subdivided once to thrice. The last leaflet subdivision is usually about 8 to 32&nbsp;mm (0.31 to 1.26&nbsp;in) wide in <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>villosa</em>; while they are only about 1.5 to 3&nbsp;mm (0.059 to 0.118&nbsp;in) wide in <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>dissecta</em>. The margins of the leaves are curled (revolute) with small teeth-like and triangular serrated edges, each tipped with small spike. The main leaf midrib (rachis) is densely covered in hair and light to dark green on the upper side, while it is smooth and grayish to greenish on the underside. The leaves are largest at the bottom and progressively become smaller the higher they are on the stem. In the upper parts of the stem, the leaves are often reduced to nothing more than petioles which form sheaths around the stem.<br /><br />Like other members of the genus, the inflorescence of <em>Thapsia villosa</em> is a compound subhemispherical to globose umbel. It has 9 to 29 spokes and is about 6 to 12&nbsp;cm (2.4 to 4.7&nbsp;in) in diameter. Bracts are usually absent, though in rare cases, one to three may be present, each around 6 to 40&nbsp;mm (0.24 to 1.57&nbsp;in) in length and lanceolate in shape. The umbellules are hemispherical to globose. Bracteoles are also usually absent, though rarely 1 or 2 may be present. Each umbellule has about 18 to 43 flowers, each with five bright yellow elliptical petals. The fruits are oblong and around 9 to 15&nbsp;mm (0.35 to 0.59&nbsp;in) long and 6 to 11&nbsp;mm (0.24 to 0.43&nbsp;in) wide. When mature, they are light to dark brown in color with four yellowish to brownish wings characteristic of the genus. The main umbel has hermaphroditic flowers, containing both stamen and pistil. Smaller umbels may develop from the sides of the stem which usually contains only stamens. These umbels wither away quickly.<br /><br /><em>Thapsia villosa</em> is highly variable in morphology. The two varieties, <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>dissecta</em> and <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>villosa</em> are usually distinguished by how many times the leaf subdivides into leaflets. <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>dissecta</em> has leaves that are deeply subdivided two or three times into narrow and small leaflets. <em>T. villosa</em> var. <em>villosa</em>, in contrast are usually subdivided only once or twice. However, there are numerous intermediate forms between the two varieties and distinguishing between them can be very difficult. The diploid chromosome number (2n) of <em>Thapsia villosa</em> is 22, 33, 44, or 66.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It was known to Theophrastus (9.1) and Pliny the Elder (<em>N.H. 19.48).</em><br /><br />These stout plants grow to 150 centimetres (59&nbsp;in) high, with a solid stem which becomes hollow and grooved with age. The leaves are bluntly toothed, the segments ternately divided the segments flat, not fleshy.<br /><br />Alexanders is native to the Mediterranean but is able to thrive farther north. The flowers are yellow-green in colour and arranged in umbels,and its fruits are black. It flowers from April to June. Alexanders is intermediate in flavor between celery and parsley. It was once used in many dishes, either blanched, or not, but it has now been replaced by celery.<br /><br />It is now almost forgotten as a food source, although it still grows wild in many parts of Europe, including Britain. It is common among the sites of medieval monastery gardens.<br /><br />Look out for this tall plant on cliff paths, the first seaside greenery of the year. The Romans brought it with them to eat the leaves, the stems, the roots, and the buds.<br /><br />Alexanders is a feed source much appreciated by horses.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The leaves are tripinnate, finely divided and lacy, and overall triangular in shape. The leaves are bristly and alternate in a pinnate pattern that separates into thin segments. The flowers are small and dull white, clustered in flat, dense umbels. The umbels are terminal and approximately 3&ndash;4 inches (8&ndash;10&nbsp;cm) wide. They may be pink in bud and may have a reddish or purple flower in the centre of the umbel. The lower bracts are three-forked or pinnate, which distinguishes the plant from other white-flowered umbellifers. As the seeds develop, the umbel curls up at the edges, becomes more congested, and develops a concave surface. The fruits are oval and flattened, with short styles and hooked spines. The fruit is small, dry and bumpy with protective hairs surrounding it. The fruit of <em>Daucus carota</em> has 2 mericarp, or bicarpellate. The endosperm of the fruit grows before the embryo. The dried umbels detach from the plant, becoming tumbleweeds. The function of the tiny red flower, coloured by anthocyanin, is to attract insects. Wild carrot blooms in summer and fall. It thrives best in sun to partial shade. Daucus carota is commonly found along roadsides and in unused fields.<br /><br />Similar in appearance to the deadly poison hemlock, <em>D.&nbsp;carota</em> is distinguished by a mix of tripinnate leaves, fine hairs on its solid green stems and on its leaves, a root that smells like carrots, and occasionally a single dark red flower in the center of the umbel.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It grows in many types of habitat, particularly disturbed areas. It is an annual herb producing a hairy stem up to half a meter in maximum height. The alternately arranged leaves are each divided into several pairs of smooth-edged lance-shaped or linear leaflets. The inflorescence is a dense compound umbel of flower clusters on very short rays, often appearing like a cluster. Each flower has five petals which are unequal in size and are white with a pinkish or reddish tinge. Each greenish or pinkish fruit is about 3 millimeters long and is coated in long prickles.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Monotropa hypopitys</strong></em> &mdash; called <strong>Dutchman's pipe</strong>, <strong>false beech-drops</strong>, <strong>pinesap</strong>, or <strong>yellow bird's-nest</strong> &mdash; is a herbaceous perennial plant, formerly classified in the families Monotropaceae or Pyrolaceae, but now included within the subfamily Monotropoideae of the blueberry family (Ericaceae). It is native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, and is scarce or rare in many areas. However, it is still the most widespread member of the subfamily. While currently included in the genus <em>Monotropa</em>, recent genetic evidence strongly suggests that <em>Monotropa hypopitys</em> should be placed in its own genus, <em>Hypopitys</em>, with the single species <em>Hypopitys monotropa</em> Crantz, but possibly containing several other species.<br /><br />Unlike most plants, it does not contain chlorophyll; it is a myco-heterotroph, getting its food through parasitism upon fungi rather than photosynthesis. These fungi form a mycorrhiza with nearby tree species.<br /><br />Plants are fleshy and grow 10&ndash;35&nbsp;cm tall. True stems are nonexistent. Instead, the only part which emerges from the soil are unbranched adventitious inflorescences which are developmentally similar to adventitious roots. All parts of the plant are pale yellowish white to reddish-tinged. The bracts are 5&ndash;10&nbsp;mm long scale-like structures, which cover most of the inflorescence. Plants flower from April to December depending on the geographic region (May to October in North America). The flowers are pendulous when young, but become erect when they begin to mature into the fruit which is a capsule. The flowers are 9&ndash;12&nbsp;mm long and produced in a cluster of 1&ndash;11 together at the apex of the inflorescence, which is a raceme. It flowers between early summer and mid autumn; plants that flower in summer are yellow and sparsely hairy, while those that flower in autumn are red and densely hairy. These two color 'forms' overlap in flowering time. It has been suggested that yellow individuals are largely self-pollinating.<br /><br />The species name is from Latinized Greek <em>hypo-</em>, 'under', and <em>pitys</em>, 'pine', referring to where pinesap often grows. However, Linnaeus misspelled it <em>hypopithys</em>. Many authorities have followed his spelling. On the other hand, it has been stated that the spelling 'is generally treated as correctable to 'hypopitys'', as followed by other authorities. The variability of the species in colour, hairiness, and in the number of flowers, has led to an extensive synonymy for the species. The entire list is over 80 synonyms; some of which include <em>Hypopitys americana</em>, <em>H. fimbriata</em>, <em>H. insignata</em>, <em>H. lanuginosa</em>, <em>H. latisquama</em>, <em>H. monotropa</em>, <em>Monotropa chinensis</em>, <em>M. hypophegea</em>, <em>M. lanuginosa</em>, <em>M. latisquama</em>, <em>M. multiflora</em> and <em>M. taiwaniana</em>.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The common name is <strong>primrose</strong>, or occasionally <strong>common primrose</strong> or <strong>English primrose</strong> to distinguish it from other <em>Primula</em> species also called primroses.<br /><br />It is a perennial growing 10&ndash;30&nbsp;cm (4&ndash;12&nbsp;in) tall, with a basal rosette of leaves which are more-or-less evergreen in favoured habitats.<br /><br />The leaves are 5&ndash;25cm long and 2&ndash;6 cm broad, often heavily wrinkled, with an irregularly crenate to dentate margin, and a usually short leaf stem. The delicately scented flowers are 2&ndash;4 cm in diameter, borne singly on short slender stems.<br /><br />The flowers are typically pale yellow, though white or pink forms are often seen in nature. The flowers are actinomorphic with a superior ovary which later forms a capsule opening by valves to release the small black seeds. The flowers are hermaphrodite but heterostylous; individual plants bear either <em>pin</em> flowers (longuistylous flower: with the capita of the style prominent) or <em>thrum</em> flowers (brevistylous flower: with the stamens prominent). Fertilisation can only take place between pin and thrum flowers. Pin-to-pin and thrum-to-thrum pollination is ineffective.The primrose is one of the earliest spring flowers in much of Europe. 'Primrose' is ultimately from Old French <em>primerose</em> or medieval Latin <em>prima rosa</em>, meaning 'first rose', though it is not closely related to the rose family Rosaceae.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The native range of the species is Europe and Western Asia and North Africa. The species has been distributed widely by humans, either deliberately as an ornamental flower or accidentally. <em>A. arvensis</em> is now naturalised almost worldwide, with a range that encompasses the Americas, Central and East Asia, the Indian Subcontinent, Malesia, the Pacific Islands, Australasia and Southern Africa.<br /><br />Traditionally included in the family Primulaceae, the genus <em>Anagallis</em> was placed in the family Myrsinaceae until that family in turn was included in Primulaceae in the APG III system.<br /><br />This common European plant is generally considered a weed and is an indicator of light soils, though it grows opportunistically in clayey soils as well. The origin of the name <em>pimpernel</em> comes from <em>pympernele</em> [1400&ndash;50]; late Middle English, derived from Middle French pimprenelle, Old French piprenelle; Vulgar Latin *piper?nella= Latin piper pepper + -?n- -ine + -ella diminutive suffix.<br /><br />The flower is most widely known as the emblem of the fictional hero the Scarlet Pimpernel.<br /><br />When found as a summer annual, the Scarlet Pimpernel has a low-growing creeping habit, but as a winter annual, it forms a half-rosette with an upright stem. It has weak sprawling stems with square cross-section growing to about 5&ndash;30 centimetres (2&ndash;12&nbsp;in) long. They bear bright green, soft, ovate sessile leaves in opposite pairs. The orange, red or blue, radially symmetric flowers, about 10&ndash;15 millimetres (0.4&ndash;0.6&nbsp;in) in diameter, are produced singly in the leaf axils from spring to autumn. The petal margins are somewhat crenate and have small glandular hairs. The stamens have lollipop hairs and therefore attract a variety of pollinators, especially flies, but the flowers are also capable of autopollination. The dehiscent capsule fruits ripen from August to October in the northern hemisphere. The weight of the fruiting body bends the stem, and the seeds are transported by the wind or rain. Blue-flowered plants (<em>A. arvensis</em> Forma <em>azurea</em>) are common in some areas, such as the Mediterranean region, and should not be confused with the related Blue pimpernel, <em>Anagallis foemina</em>, sometimes ssp. <em>foemina</em>. In 2007, a molecular phylogenetic study showed that <em>Anagallis foemina</em> is more closely related to <em>Anagallis monelli</em> than to <em>Anagallis arvensis</em>, and should be treated as a separate species. The taxonomy has however not yet been resolved and various authorities propose either the subspecies <em>Anagallis arvensis subsp. foemina</em> (Mill.) Schinz &amp; Thell, or the species <em>Lysimachia foemina</em> (Mill.) U.Manns &amp; Anderb. The plant has a diploid chromosome count of 2n=40.<br /><br />Scarlet pimpernel flowers open only when the sun shines, and even close in overcast conditions. This habit leads to names such as 'shepherd's weather glass'. It has recently started to occur along the verges of salted roads, creating a broad red band along the roadside.<br /><br />The Scarlet Pimpernel has a wide variety of flower colours. The petals of the type <em>arvensis</em> are bright red to minium-coloured; <em>carnea</em> is deep peach, <em>lilacina</em> is lilac; <em>pallida</em> is white; and <em>azurea</em> is blue. The blue form can be difficult to distinguish from <em>A. foemina</em>, but the petal margins are diagnostic: whereas <em>foemina</em> has clearly irregular petal margins with only 5 to 15 glandular hairs, <em>A. arvensis</em> f. <em>azurea</em> has 50 to 70 hairs on only slightly irregular margins.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>olive</strong>, known by the botanical name <em><strong>Olea europaea</strong></em>, meaning 'European olive', is a species of small tree in the family Oleaceae, found in the Mediterranean Basin from Portugal to the Levant, the Arabian Peninsula, and southern Asia as far east as China, as well as the Canary Islands and R&eacute;union. The species is cultivated in many places and considered naturalized in all the countries of the Mediterranean coast, as well as in Argentina, Saudi Arabia, Java, Norfolk Island, California, and Bermuda.<br /><br /><em><strong>Olea europeana sylvestris</strong></em> is a subspecies that corresponds to a smaller tree bearing noticeably smaller fruit.<br /><br />The olive's fruit, also called the olive, is of major agricultural importance in the Mediterranean region as the source of olive oil; it is one of the core ingredients in Mediterranean cuisine. The tree and its fruit give their name to the plant family, which also includes species such as lilacs, jasmine, <em>Forsythia</em>, and the true ash trees (<em>Fraxinus</em>). The word derives from Latin <em>?l?va</em> ('olive fruit', 'olive tree'; 'olive oil' is <em>?l?um</em>) a borrowing from the Greek ?&lambda;&alpha;?&alpha; (<em>ela&iacute;a</em>, 'olive fruit', 'olive tree') and ?&lambda;&alpha;&iota;&omicron;&nu; (<em>&eacute;laion</em>, 'olive oil') in the archaic form *?&lambda;&alpha;??&alpha;. The word 'oil' in multiple languages ultimately derives from the name of this tree and its fruit.<br /><br />The olive tree, <em>Olea europaea</em>, is an evergreen tree or shrub native to the Mediterranean, Asia, and Africa. It is short and squat, and rarely exceeds 8&ndash;15&nbsp;m (26&ndash;49&nbsp;ft) in height. 'Pisciottana', a unique variety comprising 40,000 trees found only in the area around Pisciotta in the Campania region of southern Italy often exceeds this, with correspondingly large trunk diameters. The silvery green leaves are oblong, measuring 4&ndash;10&nbsp;cm (1.6&ndash;3.9&nbsp;in) long and 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm (0.39&ndash;1.18&nbsp;in) wide. The trunk is typically gnarled and twisted.<br /><br />The small, white, feathery flowers, with ten-cleft calyx and corolla, two stamens, and bifid stigma, are borne generally on the previous year's wood, in racemes springing from the axils of the leaves.<br /><br />The fruit is a small drupe 1&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (0.39&ndash;0.98&nbsp;in) long, thinner-fleshed and smaller in wild plants than in orchard cultivars. Olives are harvested in the green to purple stage. Canned black olives have often been artificially blackened and may contain the chemical ferrous gluconate to improve the appearance. <em>Olea europaea</em> contains a seed commonly referred to in American English as a pit or a rock, and in British English as a stone.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Oleander is one of the most poisonous commonly grown garden plants.<br /><br />Oleander grows to 2&ndash;6&nbsp;m (6.6&ndash;19.7&nbsp;ft) tall, with erect stems that splay outward as they mature; first-year stems have a glaucous bloom, while mature stems have a grayish bark. The leaves are in pairs or whorls of three, thick and leathery, dark-green, narrow lanceolate, 5&ndash;21&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;8.3&nbsp;in) long and 1&ndash;3.5&nbsp;cm (0.39&ndash;1.38&nbsp;in) broad, and with an entire margin filled with minute reticulate venation web typical to Eudicots. Leaves are light green and very glossy when young, before maturing to a dull dark green/greenish gray.

It was formerly classified in the family Cuscutaceae.<br /><br />It is native to central North America. It is a parasite of a wide range of herbaceous plants.<br /><br />It is a pest of lucerne and other legumes. It has become a widespread weed in many countries. It is known as 'golden dodder' in Australia.<br /><br />It has been confused in some recent literature with <em>Cuscuta pentagona</em> Engelmann, but the differences between the two species are clear.<br /><br />Remarkably, the seeds of the plant have been found to become dispersed by waterfowl in significant numbers<br /><br />Parasitic plants of the genus <em>Cuscuta</em> have little to no chlorophyll making them unable to undergo photosynthesis, a process by which plants make their own food. This makes them photosynthetically inactive. <em>Cuscuta</em> species are thus referred to as holoparasitic plants, as they depend on their host plant for nutrients. About 10-15 species of <em>Cuscuta</em>, out of the known 200, are considered agricultural weeds which wrap their vines around their hosts and obtain their nutrients from them through their extensions called haustoria. This mechanism for obtaining their food makes them very difficult to remove. Their growth has been cited to cause severe loss to crops that yield alfalfa, tomatoes, carrots and cranberry crops.<br /><br />The life cycle of the <em>Cuscuta</em> starts with seed germination. The seedlings cannot survive for long periods of time hence, they find the appropriate plant stem by recognizing plant chemo-attractants. <em>Cuscuta campestris</em> is known for restraining the growth of their host plants and even inhibiting their flowering. This causes the host cell to eventually die. This mechanism gives them the ability to control other populations of weeds like <em>Mikania micrantha</em>. Another mechanism by which these dodders recognize which plants to use as hosts depends on the light that's reflected off the plant's surface. <em>Cuscuta campestris</em> is highly attracted to 'far red light', which is a wavelength that is reflected by most plant surfaces. Dodders that were exposed to unfiltered light were able to attach to their host before their energy had been totally exhausted, but dodders that were only exposed to red light lost their way. This could be a technique by which to control <em>C. campestris</em> infestations if exposed to red light within the early stages of development.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a climbing or creeping herbaceous perennial plant growing to 0.5&ndash;2 m high. There are two varieties:<ul><li><em>Convolvulus arvensis</em> var. <em>arvensis</em>. Leaves broader.</li><li><em>Convolvulus arvensis</em> var. <em>linearifolius</em>. Leaves narrower.</li></ul>Other common names, mostly obsolete, include lesser bindweed, European bindweed, withy wind (in basket willow crops), perennial morning glory, smallflowered morning glory, creeping jenny, and possession vine. It is called <em>leli</em> in Punjabi<br /><br />The leaves are spirally arranged, linear to arrowhead-shaped, 2&ndash;5&nbsp;cm long and alternate, with a 1&ndash;3&nbsp;cm petiole. The flowers are trumpet-shaped, 1-2.5&nbsp;cm diameter, white or pale pink, with five slightly darker pink radial stripes. Flowering occurs in the mid-summer, when white to pale pink, funnel-shaped flowers develop. Flowers are approximately 0.75-1 in. (1.9-2.5&nbsp;cm) across and are subtended by small bracts. Fruit are light brown, rounded and 1/8 in. (0.3&nbsp;cm) wide. Each fruit contains 2 seeds that are eaten by birds and can remain viable in the soil for decades.Although it produces attractive flowers, it is often unwelcome in gardens as a nuisance weed due to its rapid growth and choking of cultivated plants. It was most likely introduced into North America as a contaminant in crop seed as early as 1739, as an invasive species. Plants typically inhabit roadsides, grasslands and also along streams. Its dense mats invade agricultural fields and reduce crop yields; it is estimated that crop losses due to this plant in the United States exceeded US$377 million in the year 1998 alone.<br /><br />In one of the tales collected by Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm, <em>Our Lady's Little Glass</em>, this flower is used by Our Lady to drink wine with when she helps free a wagoner's cart. The story goes on to say that 'the little flower is still always called Our Lady's Little Glass.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to the Mediterranean region and has naturalized in many other locales. It grows satisfactorily in gardens in the UK climate, remaining in the garden from year to year by self-seeding. The leaves are edible and the plant is grown in gardens for that purpose in some parts of Europe. The plant is also commercially cultivated for borage seed oil extracted from its seeds. The plant contains pyrrolizidine alkaloids, some of which are hepatotoxic, mutagenic and carcinogenic (see below under Phytochemistry).<br /><br /><em>Borago officinalis</em> grows to a height of 60&ndash;100&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;3.3&nbsp;ft), and is bristly or hairy all over the stems and leaves; the leaves are alternate, simple, and 5&ndash;15&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;5.9&nbsp;in) long. The flowers are complete, perfect with five narrow, triangular-pointed petals. Flowers are most often blue, although pink flowers are sometimes observed. White flowered types are also cultivated. The blue flower is genetically dominant over the white flower. The flowers arise along scorpioid cymes to form large floral displays with multiple flowers blooming simultaneously, suggesting that borage has a high degree of geitonogamy (intra-plant pollination). It has an indeterminate growth habit which may lead to prolific spreading. In temperate climate such as in the UK, its flowering season is relatively long, from June to September. In milder climates, borage will bloom continuously for most of the year.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It spread from the Americas into the rest of the world when it was brought back to Europe by Dutch explorers and cultivated widely, soon spreading into Asia and Oceania, where it established itself as a notorious weed.<br /><br /><em>Lantana camara</em> will often outcompete other more desirable species, leading to a reduction in biodiversity. It can also cause problems if it invades agricultural areas as a result of its toxicity to livestock as well as its ability to form dense thickets which if left unchecked can greatly reduce the productivity of farm land.<br /><br />The name <em>Lantana</em> derives from the Latin name of the wayfaring tree <em>Viburnum lantana</em>, the flowers of which closely resemble <em>Lantana</em>.<br /><br /><em>Lantana camara</em> is a small perennial shrub which can grow to around 2 m tall and form dense thickets in a variety of environments. Due to extensive selective breeding throughout the 17th and 18th Centuries for use as an ornamental plant there are now many different <em>L. camara</em> cultivars.<br /><br /><em>Lantana camara</em> has small tubular shaped flowers which each have four petals and are arranged in clusters in terminal areas stems. Flowers come in many different colours including red, yellow, white, pink and orange which differ depending on location in inflorescences, age, and maturity. After pollination occurs the colour of the flowers change (typically from yellow to orangish, pinkish, or reddish), this is believed to be a signal to pollinators that the pre-change colour contains a reward as well as being sexually viable, thus increasing pollination efficiency.<br /><br />The leaves are broadly ovate, opposite, and simple and have a strong odour when crushed.<br /><br />The fruit of <em>L. camara</em> is a berry-like drupe which turns from green to dark purple when mature. Both vegetative (asexual) and seed reproduction occur. Up to 12,000 fruits can be produced by each plant which are then eaten by birds and other animals which can spread the seeds over large distances, facilitating the spread of <em>L. camara</em>.<br /><br />The flower has a tutti frutti smell with a pepper undertone.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to the Mediterranean and Asia, but is reasonably hardy in cool climates. It can withstand droughts, surviving a severe lack of water for lengthy periods. Forms range from upright to trailing; the upright forms can reach 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) tall, rarely 2&nbsp;m (6&nbsp;ft 7&nbsp;in). The leaves are evergreen, 2&ndash;4&nbsp;cm (0.8&ndash;1.6&nbsp;in) long and 2&ndash;5&nbsp;mm broad, green above, and white below, with dense, short, woolly hair. The plant flowers in spring and summer in temperate climates, but the plants can be in constant bloom in warm climates; flowers are white, pink, purple or deep blue. Rosemary also has a tendency to flower outside its normal flowering season; it has been known to flower as late as early December, and as early as mid-February (in the northern hemisphere).<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The plant is relatively important in the diet of some species of birds such as European thrushes, which feed on its fruits and are immune to its poisons, scattering the seeds abroad. It grows in all types of terrain with a preference for wetlands<sup>[<em>citation needed</em>]</sup> and the understory of riparian forests. Along with other climbers, it creates a dark and impenetrable shelter for varied animals. The plant grows well in dark areas in places where it can receive the light of morning or afternoon. An area receiving bright light for many hours reduces their development. It grows more easily in rich wet soils with plenty of nitrogen.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The word 'potato' may refer either to the plant itself or to the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is indigenous, some other closely related species are cultivated. Potatoes were introduced to Europe in the second half of the 16th century by the Spanish.<br /><br />Potato has become a staple food in many parts of the world and an integral part of much of the world's food supply. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following maize, wheat, and rice. The green leaves and green skins of tubers exposed to the light are toxic.<br /><br />Wild potato species can be found throughout the Americas from the United States to southern Chile. The potato was originally believed to have been domesticated independently in multiple locations, but later genetic testing of the wide variety of cultivars and wild species proved a single origin for potatoes in the area of present-day southern Peru and extreme northwestern Bolivia (from a species in the <em>Solanum brevicaule</em> complex), where they were domesticated approximately 7,000&ndash;10,000 years ago. Following millennia of selective breeding, there are now over a thousand different types of potatoes. Over 99% of the presently cultivated potatoes worldwide descended from varieties that originated in the lowlands of south-central Chile, which have displaced formerly popular varieties from the Andes.<br /><br />However, the local importance of the potato is variable and changing rapidly. It remains an essential crop in Europe (especially eastern and central Europe), where per capita production is still the highest in the world, but the most rapid expansion over the past few decades has occurred in southern and eastern Asia. As of 2014, China led the world in potato production, and, together with India, produced 37% of the world's potatoes.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Solanum nigrum</strong></em> (<strong>European black nightshade</strong>) is a species in the <em>Solanum</em> genus, native to Eurasia and introduced in the Americas, Australasia, and South Africa. It is also known as <strong>black nightshade</strong>, <strong>duscle</strong>, <strong>garden nightshade</strong>,<strong>Indian nightshade</strong>, <strong>garden huckleberry</strong>, <strong>hound's berry</strong>, <strong>petty morel</strong>, <strong>wonder berry</strong>, <strong>small-fruited black nightshade</strong>, or <strong>popolo</strong>. Parts of this plant can be toxic to livestock and humans. Nonetheless, ripe berries and cooked leaves of edible strains are used as food in some locales, and plant parts are used as a traditional medicine. A tendency exists in literature to incorrectly refer to many of the other 'black nightshade' species as '<em>Solanum nigrum</em>'.<br /><br /><em>Solanum nigrum</em> has been recorded from deposits of the Paleolithic and Mesolithic era of ancient Britain and it is suggested by the botanist and ecologist Edward Salisbury that it was part of the native flora there before Neolithic agriculture emerged. The species was mentioned by Pliny the Elder in the first century AD and by the great herbalists, including Dioscorides. In 1753, Carl Linnaeus described six varieties of <em>Solanum nigrum</em> in <em>Species Plantarum</em>.<br /><br />Black nightshade is a common herb or short-lived perennial shrub, found in many wooded areas, as well as disturbed habitats. It reaches a height of 30 to 120&nbsp;cm (12 to 47&nbsp;in), leaves 4.0 to 7.5&nbsp;cm (1.6 to 3.0&nbsp;in) long and 2 to 5&nbsp;cm (1 to 2&nbsp;in) wide; ovate to heart-shaped, with wavy or large-toothed edges; both surfaces hairy or hairless; petiole 1 to 3&nbsp;cm (0.5 to 1&nbsp;in) long with a winged upper portion. The flowers have petals greenish to whitish, recurved when aged and surround prominent bright yellow anthers. The berry is mostly 6 to 8&nbsp;mm (0.24 to 0.31&nbsp;in) in diam., dull black or purple-black. In India, another strain is found with berries that turn red when ripe.<br /><br />Sometimes <em>S. nigrum</em> is confused for the more toxic deadly nightshade, <em>Atropa belladonna</em>, in a different Solanaceae genus altogether. A comparison of the fruit shows that the black nightshade berries grow in bunches, the deadly nightshade berries grow individually.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Nicotiana glauca</strong></em> is a species of wild tobacco known by the common name <strong>tree tobacco</strong>. Its leaves are attached to the stalk by petioles (many other <em>Nicotiana</em> species have sessile leaves), and its leaves and stems are neither pubescent nor sticky like <em>Nicotiana tabacum</em>. It resembles <em>Cestrum parqui</em> but differs in the form of leaves and fusion of the outer floral parts. It grows to heights of more than two meters.<br /><br />Tree tobacco is native to South America but it is now widespread as an introduced species on other continents. It is a common roadside weed in the southwestern United States, and an invasive plant species in California native plant habitats.<br /><br />The plant is used for a variety of medicinal purposes and smoked by Native American groups. The Cahuilla Indians used leaves interchangeably with other tobacco species in hunting rituals and as a poultice to treat swellings, bruises, cuts, wounds, boils, sores, inflamed throat, and swollen glands. Contains the toxic alkaloid anabasine. Ingestion of the leaves can be fatal. It is being investigated for use as a biofuel<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Verbascum thapsus</strong></em> (<strong>great mullein</strong> or <strong>common mullein</strong>) is a species of mullein native to Europe, northern Africa, and Asia, and introduced in the Americas and Australia.<br /><br />It is a hairy biennial plant that can grow to 2 m tall or more. Its small, yellow flowers are densely grouped on a tall stem, which grows from a large rosette of leaves. It grows in a wide variety of habitats, but prefers well-lit, disturbed soils, where it can appear soon after the ground receives light, from long-lived seeds that persist in the soil seed bank. It is a common weedy plant that spreads by prolifically producing seeds, but it rarely becomes aggressively invasive, since its seeds require open ground to germinate. It is a very minor problem for most agricultural crops, since it is not a very competitive species, being intolerant of shade from other plants and unable to survive tilling. It also hosts many insects, some of which can be harmful to other plants. Although individuals are easy to remove by hand, populations are difficult to eliminate permanently.<br /><br />It is widely used for herbal remedies, with well-established emollient and astringent properties. Mullein remedies are especially recommended for coughs and related problems, but also used in topical applications against a variety of skin problems. The plant has also been used to make dyes and torches.<br /><br /><em>V. thapsus</em> is a dicotyledonous plant that produces a rosette of leaves in its first year of growth. The leaves are large, up to 50&nbsp;cm long. The second-year plants normally produce a single unbranched stem, usually 1&ndash;2&nbsp;m tall. In the eastern part of its range in China, it is, however, only reported to grow up to 1.5&nbsp;m tall. The tall, pole-like stems end in a dense spike of flowers that can occupy up to half the stem length. All parts of the plants are covered with star-shaped trichomes. This cover is particularly thick on the leaves, giving them a silvery appearance. The species' chromosome number is 2n&nbsp;=&nbsp;36.<br /><br />On flowering plants, the leaves are alternately arranged up the stem. They are thick and decurrent, with much variation in leaf shape between the upper and lower leaves on the stem, ranging from oblong to oblanceolate, and reaching sizes up to 50&nbsp;cm long and 14&nbsp;cm across (19&nbsp;inches long and 5&nbsp;inches wide). They become smaller higher up the stem, and less strongly decurrent down the stem. The flowering stem is solid and 2&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (nearly an inch) across, and occasionally branched just below the inflorescence, usually following damage. After flowering and seed release, the stem and fruits usually persist in winter, drying into dark brown, stiff structures of densely packed, ovoid-shaped, and dry seed capsules. The dried stems may persist into the following spring or even the next summer. The plant produces a shallow taproot.<br /><br />Flowers are pentamerous with (usually) five stamen, a five-lobed calyx tube and a five-petalled corolla, the latter bright yellow and an 1.5&ndash;3&nbsp;cm (0.59&ndash;1.18&nbsp;in) wide. The flowers are almost sessile, with very short pedicels (2&nbsp;mm, 0.08&nbsp;in). The five stamens are of two types, with the three upper stamens being shorter, their filaments covered by yellow or whitish hairs, and having smaller anthers, while the lower two stamens have glabrous filaments and larger anthers. The plant produces small, ovoid (6&nbsp;mm, 0.24&nbsp;in) capsules that split open by way of two valves, each capsule containing large numbers of minute, brown seeds less than 1 mm (0.04&nbsp;in) in size, marked with longitudinal ridges. A white-flowered form, <em>V.&nbsp;thapsus</em> f. <em>candicans</em>, is known to occur. Flowering lasts up to three months from early to late summer (June to August in northern Europe), with flowering starting at the bottom of the spike and progressing irregularly upward; each flower opens for part of a day and only a few open at the same time around the stem.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

This genus is native to western and southwestern Europe, western and central Asia and northwestern Africa. The scientific name means 'finger-like' and refers to the ease with which a flower of <em>Digitalis purpurea</em> can be fitted over a human fingertip. The flowers are produced on a tall spike, are tubular, and vary in colour with species, from purple to pink, white, and yellow. The best-known species is the common foxglove, <em>Digitalis purpurea</em>. This biennial plant is often grown as an ornamental plant due to its vivid flowers which range in colour from various purple tints through various shades of light gray, and to purely white. The flowers can also possess various marks and spottings.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is an upright plant reaching 70&nbsp;cm with blunt oval, crenate leaves in alternate pairs on the greenish&ndash;purple square stem, most leaves may have two small lobes at their base. The spikes of flowers are held stiffly on square stems which arise from the main stem in the angle of the leaf stalks. The square stems have a wing running down each corner. These wings are more obvious than on the closely related common figwort (<em>Scrophularia nodosa</em>). The flowers are small, maroon-brownish and globular with two small lips above and below. The five sepals are green with a white margin, broader on the water figwort than the common figwort. The plant flowers from June to September after when the flowers produce small spherical to pear-shaped capsules containing a large number of seeds.<br /><br />The name <em>auriculata</em> derives from the auricles at the base of the leaves.<br /><br />The water figwort is host to the figwort sawfly whose larvae feed on the leaves.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The plant was placed in the <em>Plantaginaceae</em> family following a revision its prior classical family, <em>Scrophulariaceae.</em> It is native to the Mediterranean region, from Morocco and Portugal north to southern France, and east to Turkey and Syria. The common name 'snapdragon', originates from the flowers' reaction to having their throats squeezed, which causes the 'mouth' of the flower to snap open like a dragon's mouth.<br /><br />It is an herbaceous perennial plant, growing to 0.5&ndash;1 m tall, rarely up to 2 m. The leaves are spirally arranged, broadly lanceolate, 1&ndash;7&nbsp;cm long and 2-2.5&nbsp;cm broad. The flowers are produced on a tall spike, each flower is 3.5-4.5&nbsp;cm long, zygomorphic, with two 'lips' closing the corolla tube; wild plants have pink to purple flowers, often with yellow lips. The fruit is an ovoid capsule 10&ndash;14&nbsp;mm diameter, containing numerous small seeds. The plants are pollinated by bumblebees, and the flowers close over the insects when they enter and deposit pollen on their bodies.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em>Acanthus mollis</em>, commonly known as bear's breeches, sea dock, bearsfootor oyster plant, is a herbaceous perennial plant with an underground rhizome in the genus <em>Acanthus</em>. It is regarded as an invasive species in some jurisdictions.<br/><br/><em>Acanthus mollis </em>reaches on average 30–80 centimetres of height, with a maximum of 180 centimetres, inflorescence included. It has basal clusters of deeply lobed and cut, shiny dark green leaves, soft to the touch, up to 40 centimetres (16 in) long and 25 centimetres (9.8 in) broad, with a long petiole. The inflorescence is a cylindrical spike 30–40 centimetres long and can produce up to 120 flowers. The flowers are tubular, whitish, and lilac or rose in colour. Each flower is up to 5 centimetres  long and it is surrounded by three green or purplish bracts. The central bract is spiny and larger than the other two. The calyx has two lips: the upper is purple on top, rather long and forms a kind of 'helmet' on top of the corolla. The corolla is reduced to a white lower lip, trilobed, with purple-pink venation. The four stamens are fused to the corolla and look like tiny brushes. This species flowers in late spring or early summer, from May through August.<br/><br/><em> Acanthus mollis </em>is entomophilous and it is pollinated only by bees or bumble bees large enough to force their way between the upper sepal and the lower, so that they can reach the nectar at the bottom of the tube. The fruit is an ovoid capsule containing two to four large black seeds. The dispersal of seeds is by the wind (anemochory).<br/><br/>These plants are usually propagated from tubers and tend to form large, localized clumps which can survive for several decades and look statuesque when well-grown, but its suitability as a garden plant is lessened on account of its invasive nature (new plants are produced readily both from seed and portions of root) and its susceptibility to powdery mildew and attacks from snails.<br/><br/>This plant is native to the Mediterranean region from Portugal and northwest Africa east to Croatia and it is one of the earliest cultivated species. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It can grow in semi-shade or in full sunlight.<br /><br />The species appears in a wide range of colours from red-brown, yellow-brown to purple. Yellow specimens are also not uncommon and it is this extreme variability that makes identification on the basis of size or colour uncertain. It is parasitic on various members of the pea (Fabaceae) and daisy (Asteraceae) families. Although widespread, its appearance is sporadic; despite this, it can occur in vast colonies from time to time. The main flowering season in the northern hemisphere is from May until the end of August and from August to January in the southern hemisphere. The species has efficient seed dispersal and is largely inbreeding so that populations preferentially parasitizing a particular species which has its own clear ecological preferences may become effectively isolated and eventually may produce distinct taxa.<br /><br />The plants are attached to their host by means of haustoria, which transfer nutrients from the host to the parasite. Only the hemiparasitic species possess an additional extensive root system. The root system is reduced as its function is mainly anchorage of the plant.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Plantago major</strong></em> (<strong>broadleaf plantain</strong>, <strong>white man's foot</strong>, or <strong>greater plantain</strong>) is a species of flowering plant in the plantain family Plantaginaceae. The plant is native to most of Europe and northern and central Asia, but has widely naturalised elsewhere in the world.<br /><br /><em>Plantago major</em> is one of the most abundant and widely distributed medicinal crops in the world. A poultice of the leaves can be applied to wounds, stings, and sores in order to facilitate healing and prevent infection. The active chemical constituents are aucubin (an anti-microbial agent), allantoin (which stimulates cellular growth and tissue regeneration), and mucilage (which reduces pain and discomfort). Plantain has astringent properties, and a tea made from the leaves can be ingested to treat diarrhea and soothe raw internal membranes.<br /><br />Broadleaf plantain is also a highly nutritious wild edible, that is high in calcium and vitamins A, C, and K. The young, tender leaves can be eaten raw, and the older, stringier leaves can be boiled in stews and eaten.<br /><br /><em>Plantago major</em> is an herbaceous perennial plant with a rosette of leaves 15&ndash;30&nbsp;cm in diameter.<br /><br />Each leaf is oval-shaped, 5&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long and 4&ndash;9&nbsp;cm broad, rarely up to 30&nbsp;cm long and 17&nbsp;cm broad, with an acute apex and a smooth margin; there are five to nine conspicuous veins. The flowers are small, greenish-brown with purple stamens, produced in a dense spike 5&ndash;15&nbsp;cm long on top of a stem 13&ndash;15&nbsp;cm tall (rarely to 700&nbsp;cm tall).<br /><br />Plantain is wind-pollinated, and propagates primarily by seeds, which are held on the long, narrow spikes which rise well above the foliage. Each plant can produce up to 20,000 seeds, which are very small and oval-shaped, with a bitter taste.<sup>[11]</sup><br /><br />There are three subspecies:<ul><li><em>Plantago major</em> subsp. <em>major</em>.</li><li><em>Plantago major</em> subsp. <em>intermedia</em> (DC.)

The leaves are generally 5&ndash;8&nbsp;cm in length. Their form changes from the bottom to the top of the plant, the lower leaves being petioled while the upper leaves are sessile. The leaves grow in opposite pairs and are oval or lanceolate in shape. The plant flowers profusely, and though the individual flowers are small (no more than 2&nbsp;cm), the inflorescences are large and showy. The flowers are small in rounded clusters each with 5 fused petals and a spur. The most typical color is a brick red or purplish red, but colors include deep crimson, pale pink, and lavender. <em>Centranthus ruber</em> 'Albus' (about 10% of individuals) has white blooms. Flowering takes place in early summer and, in cool summer areas, continues sporadically throughout the summer and into fall. The cultivar 'coccineus' is especially long-blooming. The blooms have a strong and somewhat rank scent. They are pollinated by both bees and butterflies and the plant is noted for attracting insects. It is used as a food plant by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including Angle Shades. Seeds have tufts similar to dandelions that allow wind dispersal, and as such can self-seed freely and become invasive if not properly controlled.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is known in the Americas, southern Africa, Australia and New Zealand as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. The inflorescence is a cylindrical array of lavender flowers which dries to a cone of spine-tipped hard bracts. It may be 10 centimeters long.<br /><br />It is a herbaceous biennial plants (rarely short-lived perennial plants) growing to 1&ndash;2.5 metres (3.3&ndash;8.2&nbsp;ft) tall.<br /><br />The genus name is derived from the word for thirst and refers to the cup-like formation made where sessile leaves merge at the stem. Rain water can collect in this receptacle; this may perform the function of preventing sap-sucking insects such as aphids from climbing the stem. A recent experiment has shown that adding dead insects to these cups increases the seedset of teasels (but not their height), implying partial carnivory. The leaf shape is lanceolate, 20&ndash;40 centimetres (7.9&ndash;15.7&nbsp;in) long and 3&ndash;6 centimetres (1.2&ndash;2.4&nbsp;in) broad, with a row of small spines on the underside of the midrib.<br /><br />Teasels are easily identified with their prickly stem and leaves, and the inflorescence of purple, dark pink or lavender flowers that form a head on the end of the stem(s). The inflorescence is ovoid, 4&ndash;10 centimetres (1.6&ndash;3.9&nbsp;in) long and 3&ndash;5 centimetres (1.2&ndash;2.0&nbsp;in) broad, with a basal whorl of spiny bracts. The first flowers begin opening in a belt around the middle of the spherical or oval flowerhead, and then open sequentially toward the top and bottom, forming two narrow belts as the flowering progresses. The dried head persists afterwards, with the small (4&ndash;6 millimetres (0.16&ndash;0.24&nbsp;in)) seeds maturing in mid autumn.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It probably originates in North America and has been extensively naturalized elsewhere.<br /><br />The species is monoecious, with the flowers borne in separate unisexual heads: staminate (male) heads situated above the pistillate (female) heads in the inflorescence. The pistillate heads consist of two pistillate flowers surrounded by a spiny involucre. Upon fruiting, these two flowers ripen into two brown to black achenes and they are completely enveloped by the involucre, which becomes a bur. The bur, being buoyant, easily disperses in the water for plants growing along waterways. However, the bur, with its hooked projections, is obviously adapted to dispersal via mammals by becoming entangled in their hair. Once dispersed and deposited on the ground, typically one of the seeds germinates and the plants grows out of the bur.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The small marsh flower <em><strong>Cotula coronopifolia</strong></em> bears the common names <strong>brass buttons</strong>, <strong>golden buttons</strong>, and <strong>buttonweed</strong>. The flower heads are bright yellow discoid heads that look like thick buttons. Individual plants spread stems along the ground and send up the knobby flowers at intervals. The plant is native to southern Africa, but it has been introduced to other parts of the world (Europe, North + South America, etc.).<br /><br />Brass buttons are common plants that occupy a specialized ecological niche. They prefer muddy, anoxic wetlands and brackish water. They are very salt-tolerant. The plant has fat, fleshy leaves that store water during times of saline inundation. The reddish stems and green, blade-shaped leaves are coated with a shiny cuticle to retain moisture. It can also be found in the wetter patches in vernal pool ecosystems. Brass buttons are common along beaches, salt marshes, and estuaries from California to Washington.<br /><br />Although brass buttons is known to be invasive, its spread appears to be relatively slow. It's California Invasive Plant Council Inventory rating is 'limited', that is, 'invasive but their ecological impacts are minor on a statewide level or there was not enough information to justify a higher score. Their reproductive biology and other attributes result in low to moderate rates of invasiveness. Ecological amplitude and distribution are generally limited, but these species may be locally persistent and problematic.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Centaurea calcitrapa</strong></em> is a species of flowering plant known by several common names, including <strong>red star-thistle</strong> and <strong>purple starthistle</strong>. It is native to Europe but is rarely found there, it is known across the globe as an introduced species and often a noxious weed. The species name <em>calcitrapa</em> comes from the word <em>caltrop</em>, a type of weapon covered in sharp spikes.<br /><br />In western Crete, Greece a local variety called gourounaki (&gamma;&omicron;&upsilon;&rho;&omicron;&upsilon;&nu;?&kappa;&iota; - little pig) has its leaves eaten boiled by the locals. A south Italian variety of the species is also traditionally consumed by ethnic Albanians (Arb&euml;resh&euml; people) in the Vulture area (southern Italy). In the Arb&euml;resh&euml; communities in Lucania the young whorls of Centaurea calcitrapa are boiled and fried in mixtures with other weedy non cultivated greens. According to a research by A. Pieroni, V. Janiak, C. M. D&uuml;rr, S. L&uuml;deke, E. Trachsel and M. Heinrich (2002) in the Centre for Pharmacognosy and Phytotherapy (The School of Pharmacy, University of London) 'the antioxidant activity of the young whorls of Centaurea calcitrapa, both in the DPPH and in the lipid peroxidation inhibition assays, are very interesting and the species should be investigated phytochemically and biochemically focusing on these properties'. Extracts from Centaurea calcitrapa found to have significant xanthine oxidase (XO)-inhibiting activity and showed significant antioxidant activity too.<br /><br />This an annual or Biennial plant growing erect to a maximum height of one to 1.3 metres.<br /><br />The stems are hairless and grooved.<br /><br />It sometimes takes the shape of a mound, and it is finely to densely hairy to spiny. The leaves are dotted with resin glands. The lowermost may reach a length of 20 centimeters and are deeply cut into lobes. The inflorescence contains a few flower heads. Each is 1.5 to 2 centimeters long and oval in general shape. The phyllaries are green or straw-colored and tipped in tough, sharp yellow spines. The head contains many bright purple flowers. The fruit is an achene a few millimeters long which lacks a pappus.<br /><br />It flowers from July until September, and the seeds ripen from August to October.<br /><br />The Red Star-thistle has been identified as a Priority Species by the UK Biodiversity Action Plan. It is identified as 'vulnerable' by the UNIC and is listed as Nationally Rare in the UK Red Data Book. There is no national or Sussex BAP for this species.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Crupina vulgaris</strong></em> is a species of flowering plant in the aster family, Asteraceae. Its common names include <strong>common crupina</strong>, <strong>bearded-creeper</strong>, <strong>false saw-wort</strong>, and <strong>starry scabious</strong>. It is native to parts of Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and it is known elsewhere as an introduced species and often a noxious weed.<br /><br />This winter annual herb produces a slender stem reaching about 120 cm (4 feet) in height. The ridged stem has many branches, and is leafy below. The basal leaves are entire, toothed, or divided, and have rough-haired surfaces and bristly edges. They generally wither by flowering. Leaves higher on the stem are up to 3.5 centimeters long and are divided into narrow lobes with bristly edges. The slender flower head is about 1 or 2 centimeters long. It contains up to 5 florets, usually only one of which is fertile. It has a purple corolla. It yields one large fruit, a cypsela up to 1.6 centimeters long including its barrel-shaped body and its long, spreading pappus of brown or black bristles. It can weigh up to 36 milligrams. One average plant produces about 130 fruits.<br /><br />The flower heads often fall off the plant after the seeds ripen, each containing one fruit, or occasionally two in heads that produced two fertile florets. The seeds fall out and are dispersed by the wind or on the feet of livestock; they can be dispersed greater distances when floating on water or when transported by rodents, birds, or humans, including on machinery and in contaminated shipments of hay or grain. The seeds can pass unscathed through the guts of most animals, except sheep. The cotyledons of the seedling have a bright purple red, or purplish red midvein and margins.<br /><br />The plant can grow in a range of temperatures, moisture levels, and soil types, and in many types of habitat, including fields, pastures, grasslands, roadsides, railroads, and dump sites. It is not invasive in its native range, but in regions where it has naturalized, such as the rangelands of the western United States, it can negatively affect native flora through competition, reduce the quality of forage, and increase soil erosion. The plant can form wide stands in fields. It is unpalatable to most grazing animals, which avoid it and selectively consume other grasses and herbs, allowing the weed to survive and spread. Sheep and goats will consume the plant, but are not effective agents of eradication.<br /><br />A number of natural enemies have been recorded, such as the mite <em>Aceria balasi</em>, which attacks the inflorescence, the moths <em>Clytie illunaris</em>, <em>Metzneria aprilella</em>, and <em>Ornativalva plutelliformis</em>, which feed on the seeds, and the weevil <em>Styphlus penicillus</em>, which feeds on the leaves. <em>Ramularia crupinae</em>, first described from the plant, is a pathogenic sac fungus that grows on its leaves. No agents of biological pest control have been established.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

This is a spiny, glandular, woolly plant, which often looks like it is covered in spiderweb due to its fine tangled fibers. It has a pale stem which may reach a meter in height, and rigid, pointed, very spiny leaves. The flower head has many long, sharp phyllaries that can be up to several centimeters long, and often bend backwards (recurved). The disc florets are bright yellow. One plant can produce many stems which mat together due to their spininess and form a small thicket.

In English it is sometimes called <strong>Cupid's dart</strong>.<br /><br />It is native to the Mediterranean region. The flower was supposedly used by the ancient Greeks as a key ingredient in a love potion, hence the common name 'Cupid's dart'.<br /><br />Cupid's dart is a short-lived perennial herbaceous plant, of 20&ndash;90&nbsp;cm high. It has eighteen chromosomes (2n=18).<br /><br />There is a basal rosette of many linear leaves of 2&ndash;20&nbsp;cm long and &frac14;&ndash;&frac34;&nbsp;cm wide, which may be entire or are pinnately incised, creating linear lobes mostly directed towards the tip. The leaves are covered in long soft woolly hairs (pilose) lying on the surface, giving both leaf surfaces a greyish green color. The leaf tips may be blunt or pointy, and the leaf blade gradually narrows to the main vein at the base of the leaf. From the heart of the rosette one or a few, strongly branched, erect, again woolly haired and greyish green flowering stems rise. These stems carry only a few leaves, similar to the basal leaves, but up to 30&nbsp;cm long, with up to four lateral lobes.<br /><br />Flowerheads are set individually at the end of a branch of up to 30&nbsp;cm long, with a few small papery bracts, more densely set near the flowerhead.

The individual bracts are papery, egg-shaped, 1&ndash;2&frac12;&nbsp;cm long, ?&ndash;&frac12;&nbsp;cm wide, hairless and ending abruptly in a small sharp point as a continuation of the darker colored midrib. The common base at which the florets are implanted (or receptacle) is flat, with a scale subtending every floret. The ligulate florets have a bluish purple strap ending in five teeth, 2&frac12;&ndash;2?&nbsp;cm long, while the tube is darker. The one-seeded indehiscent fruit (called cypsela) is cylindrical with five to ten longitudal ribs, 5&ndash;6&nbsp;mm long, and is crowned with papery pappus scales.

The plant is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it is known throughout most temperate regions of the world as an introduced species which is usually considered a noxious weed.<br /><br />It is a thin, spindly plant which reaches a meter in height. It starts from a basal rosette of leaves and branches extensively, often forming a weedy thicket. It produces small daisylike flowers with rectangular yellow ray florets. The fruit is an achene about a centimeter long topped with a white pappus. It reproduces by seed but also by cloning itself at the root; tilling of soil and chopping up plants actually help this species disperse by sectioning and distributing root parts.<br /><br />This plant is considered a very troublesome weed in many areas. It easily invades fields, clogs harvesting machines, and successfully competes with other plants for water. There are several biological control measures used against this plant. The skeletonweed gall midge (<em>Cystiphora schmidti</em> - an insect), the skeletonweed gall mite (<em>Aceria chondrillae</em> - an arachnid), and skeletonweed rust (<em>Puccinia chondrillina</em> - a fungus) all show potential for controlling infestations.<br /><br />In the Greek island of Crete the leaves and the tender shoots of a local variety called ampelosyrida (&alpha;&mu;&pi;&epsilon;&lambda;&omicron;&sigma;&upsilon;&rho;?&delta;&alpha;) or glykosyrida (&gamma;&lambda;&upsilon;&kappa;&omicron;&sigma;&upsilon;&rho;?&delta;&alpha;) are eaten raw or boiled in salads by the locals. The plant is also traditionally consumed by ethnic Albanians (Arb&euml;resh&euml;) in the Vulture area (southern Italy). <em>Chondrilla juncea</em> may have a anti-oxidant activity and some potential for medicinal use. XO-inhibiting activity shown by extracts of the aerial parts of the plant with potential benefits for hyperuricaemia and gout.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Both species are edible in their entirety. The common name dandelion, from French <em>dent-de-lion</em>, meaning 'lion's tooth') is given to members of the genus. Like other members of the Asteraceae family, they have very small flowers collected together into a composite flower head. Each single flower in a head is called a floret. Many <em>Taraxacum</em> species produce seeds asexually by apomixis, where the seeds are produced without pollination, resulting in offspring that are genetically identical to the parent plant.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Posidonia oceanica</strong></em> (commonly known as Neptune grass or Mediterranean tapeweed) is a seagrass species that is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. It forms large underwater meadows that are an important part of the ecosystem. The fruit is free floating and known in Italy as 'the olive of the sea' (<em>l'oliva di mare</em>). Balls of fibrous material from its foliage, known as <em>egagropili</em>, or as <em>nun's farts</em>, wash up to nearby shorelines.<br /><br /><em>Posidonia oceanica</em> is a flowering plant which lives in dense meadows or along channels in the sands of the Mediterranean. It is found at depths from 1&ndash;35 metres (3.3&ndash;114.8&nbsp;ft), according to water clarity. Subsurface rhizomes and roots stabilize the plant while erect rhizomes and leaves reduce silt accumulation.<br /><br />The leaves are ribbon-like, appearing in tufts of 6 or 7, and up to 1.5 metres (4.9&nbsp;ft) long. Average leaf width is around 10 millimetres (0.39&nbsp;in). The leaves are bright green, perhaps turning brown with age, and have 13 to 17 parallel veins. The leaf terminus is rounded or sometimes absent because of damage. Leaves are arranged in groups, with older leaves on the outside, longer and differing in form from the younger leaves they surround.<br /><br />The rhizome type stems are found in two forms: one growing up to 150 centimetres (59&nbsp;in) beneath the sand and the other rising above the sand. All stems are approximately 10 millimetres (0.39&nbsp;in) thick and upright in habit. This arrangement of the rhizomes eventually forms a mat; the surface contains the active parts of the plant, whereas the center is a dense network of roots and decomposing stems.<br /><br />The flowering plant's common name is Neptune grass. In 2006 a huge clonal colony of <em>P. oceanica</em> was discovered south of the island of Ibiza. At 8 kilometres (5.0&nbsp;mi) across, and estimated at around 100,000 years old,<sup>[4]</sup> it may be one of the largest and oldest clonal colonies on Earth.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a perennial plant, but it may grow as an annual. The rhizome grows horizontally through the substrate, anchoring via clusters of roots at nodes. The plant is monoecious, with an individual bearing both male and female flowers in separate alternating clusters. The inflorescence is about 10&nbsp;cm long. The fruit is a nutlet with a transparent coat containing the seed. The plant can also undergo vegetative reproduction, sprouting repeatedly from its rhizome and spreading into a meadow-like colony on the seabed known as a genet. One meadow of cloned eelgrass was determined to be 3000 years old, genetically. When undergoing sexual reproduction, the plant produces large quantities of seeds, at times numbering several thousand seeds per square meter of plants. The plant disperses large distances when its stems break away and carry the fertile seeds to new areas, eventually dropping to the seabed. The seagrass is a favorite food of several species of waterfowl, which may also distribute the seeds.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is found in shallow peaty calcareous lakes, ponds and ditches, commonly associated with lowland fens.<br /><br />Fen pondweed grows from perennial, creeping rhizomes. The leaves are broad, thin and translucent with noticeable reticulate veining. Both floating and submerged leaves are produced but the difference between these is often rather indistinct, rather than the marked dimorphism seen in other pondweeds. Often, the leaves of fen pondweed are simply longer and narrower lower down the stem and shorter and rounder towards its apex; the leaves towards the apex of the stem may be floating but often grow just below the surface, giving the plant a distinctive 'drowned' appearance, as though water levels have recently risen. Submerged leaves are 70&ndash;175&nbsp;mm long and 10&ndash;30&nbsp;mm wide. All leaves have the stalk shorter than the blade, and the submerged leaves are almost sessile. The leaves are typically reddish to brownish in colour.<br /><br />Flowers are produced in June to July. Like all pondweeds, they are small and greenish, in spikes up to 45&nbsp;mm long. The fruits of this species are smaller (1.5-1.9&nbsp;mm long x 1.0-1.3&nbsp;mm wide) than Broad-leaved pondweed <em>Potamogeton natans</em> and Bog Pondweed <em>Potamogeton polygonifolius</em>. Turions are not produced.<br /><br />Fen pondweed could be confused with other pondweeds, especially bog pondweed <em>P. polygonifolius</em>, to which it is closely related. However, bog pondweed produces completely opaque floating leaves that are very distinct from the submerged leaves; the submerged leaves are longer and die back relatively early in the season. Bog pondweed also lacks the distinctive net-veined appearance. <em>Potamogeton lucens</em> has leaves with a similar net-veined appearance, but is more uniform in its growth habit, has denticulate (finely toothed) leaf margins and stipules with two conspicuous keels.<br /><br /><em>Potamogeton coloratus</em> is diploid, with 2n=28.<br /><br />Hybrids have been described with <em>P. berchtoldii</em> (<em>P</em>. &times; <em>lanceolatus</em><small>Sm.</small>) and <em>P. gramineus</em> (<em>P</em>. &times; <em>billupsii</em><small>Fryer</small>), but both are rare.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a hardy perennial plant.<br /><br /><em>Allium sphaerocephalon</em> is found in the wild across all parts of Europe except in the northernmost countries (Ireland, Netherlands, Scandinavia, and the Baltic States). Its native range extends to northern Africa and to western Asia as far east as Iran. It is also reportedly naturalised in New York State in the US. In the UK it only grows wild in the Avon Gorge so is known locally as the <strong>Bristol onion</strong>.<br /><br />The species is prized by gardeners because of its striking floral display. The spherical 'head' (technically an umbel) is borne on a long scape, up to 50&nbsp;cm in height, usually in July. It can contain hundreds of deep purple flowers.<br /><br /><em>Allium sphaerocephalon</em> produces egg-shaped bulbs.

Flowers are borne on a scape up to 50&nbsp;cm in height, in a spherical to egg-shaped umbel, 1&ndash;6&nbsp;cm in diameter, tightly packed with many flowers crowded together. The relatively small size of the umbel relative to the height of the stem makes this one of those described as 'drumstick alliums'.

The underground bulb is 1&ndash;2&nbsp;cm diameter, with a fibrous outer layer. The main stem grows to 30&ndash;120&nbsp;cm tall, bearing 2&ndash;4 leaves and an apical inflorescence 2&ndash;5&nbsp;cm diameter comprising a number of small bulbils and none to a few flowers, subtended by a basal bract. The leaves are slender hollow tubes, 15&ndash;60&nbsp;cm long and 2&ndash;4&nbsp;mm thick, waxy texture, with a groove along the side of the leaf facing the stem. The inflorescence is a tight umbel surrounded by a membranous bract in bud which withers when the flowers open. Each individual flower is stalked and has a pinkish-green perianth 2.5 to 4.5&nbsp;mm (0.10 to 0.18&nbsp;in) long. There are six tepals, six stamens and a pistil formed from three fused carpels. Mixed with the flowers are several of yellowish-brown bulbils. The fruit is a capsule but the seeds seldom set and propagation usually takes place when the bulbils are knocked off and grow into new plants.

It is found in rocky ground and cultivated areas, such as cornfields and vineyards, in south-east Europe to Turkey and Iran, but has naturalized elsewhere. In southern Italy, Portugal and Greece, its bulb is a culinary delicacy.<br /><br />Described by Oleg Polunin as 'a striking plant', it has a tuft of bright blue to violet-blue sterile flowers above brownish-green fertile flowers, which open from dark blue buds, reminiscent of a menorah candelabrum. This tuft gives rise to the name 'tassel hyacinth'. The flower stem is 20&ndash;60&nbsp;cm tall; individual flowers are borne on long stalks, purple in the case of the sterile upper flowers. Mature fertile flowers are 5&ndash;10&nbsp;mm long with stalks of this length or more and are bell-shaped, opening at the mouth, where there are paler lobes. The linear leaves are 5&ndash;15&nbsp;mm wide, with a central channel.<br /><br /><em>Leopoldia comosa</em> naturalizes easily and may become invasive. It has spread northwards from its original distribution, for example appearing in the British Isles in the 16th century.<br /><br />In a cultivar called 'Monstrosum' or 'Plumosum', all the flowers have become branched purple stems.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is used for the treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and various other memory impairments, in particular those of vascular origin. It is an alkaloid that is obtained synthetically or from the bulbs and flowers of Galanthus, and some other members of the family Amaryllidaceae such as Narcissus (daffodil), Leucojum aestivum (snowflake), and Lycoris including Lycoris radiata (red spider lily).<br /><br />The Loddon Lily (another name for Leucojum aestivum) is almost wholly associated with rivers. After flowering in April or May, when it is pollinated by bees, the fruits develop flotation chambers. The fruit remain attached to the stem, in the event of flooding the stems break and the fruits are carried downstream and stranded in river debris or on flood-plains. The bulbs can also be transported during heavy floods and deposited on river banks.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a medium- to high-maintenance grass that forms a thick, carpetlike sod, crowding out most weeds and other grasses.<br /><br />St. Augustine is a dark green grass with broad, flat blades. It spreads by aboveground stolons, commonly known as 'runners', and forms a dense layer.<br /><br />The grass occurs on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean, including much of the southeastern United States, Texas, Mexico, and Central and South America. It has escaped cultivation in California, Hawaii, many Pacific islands, and New Zealand.<br /><br />St. Augustine grass occurs in most Caribbean and Mediterranean areas. It grows best in tropical climates. It is often seen in lagoons and marshes, on shorelines, and wherever there is a good amount of moisture.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Barley has been used as animal fodder, as a source of fermentable material for beer and certain distilled beverages, and as a component of various health foods. It is used in soups and stews, and in barley bread of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into malt in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.<br /><br />In 2014, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (144 million tonnes) behind maize, rice and wheat.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is quite widespread and common. It flowers during May through July in mainly coastal areas. It produces small, dry nutlets and its leaves can be 8&nbsp;mm wide with short, blunt ligules.<br /><br />In the United Kingdom it is absent throughout most of Ireland and Scotland but is common in England and Wales.<br /><br />Subspecies include ssp. <em>leporinum</em>, known as <strong>hare barley</strong>, <strong>mouse barley</strong>, and <strong>barley grass</strong>. It grows in tufts from 10 to 40 centimetres in height. It was first published as the full species <em>Hordeum leporinum</em> by Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link in 1834. In 1882 it was redescribed as a subspecies of <em>H.&nbsp;murinum</em> by Giovanni Arcangeli. Today some authorities maintain it at the species level. It is native to Europe, northern Africa and temperate Asia, and it is widely naturalised elsewhere. Barley grass is known in Chinese as <em><strong>m&agrave;iq?ng</strong></em> (??) and is a common ingredient in the spring snack <em>qingtuan</em>.<br /><br /><em>Hordeum murinum</em> is an annual winter species whose seeds germinate and develop in the spring. It is also referred to as wall barley and are tetraploids. It is distinct from other species of the genus because of its morphology and molecular genetics. It is also distinct because of the barriers it has with the Hordeum taxa when it comes to its ability to cross with it.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The plant stem can grow up to one meter tall, with inflorescence in the ears and purple grain. It has a global distribution.<br /><br />Darnel usually grows in the same production zones as wheat and was a serious weed of cultivation until modern sorting machinery enabled darnel seeds to be separated efficiently from seed wheat. The similarity between these two plants is so great that in some regions, darnel is referred to as 'false wheat'. It bears a close resemblance to wheat until the ear appears. The spikes of <em>L. temulentum</em> are more slender than those of wheat. The spikelets are oriented edgeways to the rachis and have only a single glume, while those of wheat are oriented with the flat side to the rachis and have two glumes. The wheat will also appear brown when ripe, whereas the darnel is black.<br /><br />Darnel can be infected by an endophytic fungus of the genus <em>Neotyphodium</em>, and the endophyte-produced, insecticidal loline alkaloids were first isolated from this plant.<br /><br />The French word for darnel is <em>ivraie</em> (from Latin <em>ebriacus</em>, intoxicated), which expresses the drunken nausea from eating the infected plant, which can be fatal<sup>.</sup> The French name echoes the scientific name, Latin <em>temulentus</em> 'drunk.'<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

In its native lands, the grass thrives in mainly rocky, serpentine soil, but also does well in grasslands and ruderal/disturbed ground as well as oak woodlands.<br/><br/>Barbed goatgrass grows to be about 8 to 16 inches tall with few to many rigid, loosely erect aerial stems (culms). In late spring the plant produces rigid flower spikes consisting of three to six spikelets bearing long, stiff awns which assist in seed distribution. When the grass matures, the spikelets fall off in their entirety to germinate on the ground, and the long awns which give the plant its name assist in dispersal by animals, wind or water. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The leaf blades are up to 40 centimeters long and 2.5 wide and glabrous. The inflorescence is a dense, compact, spikelike panicle up to 20 centimeters long, growing erect or sometimes nodding at the tip only. Spikelets are 1.8 - 2.2&nbsp;mm long.

Foxtail Millet was cultivated in China by 2700 B.C. and during the Stone Age in Europe.<br /><br /><em>S.&nbsp;viridis</em> has been proposed as a model to study C4 photosynthesis and related bioenergy grasses. It has a short life cycle (6&ndash;8 weeks), is transformable and is currently being sequenced. Genetic resources are currently being developed by a number of groups.

Originally a native of the Mediterranean region, it is now grown commercially in several parts of the world for birdseed. This large, coarse grass has erect, hairless stems, usually from 2 to 6 feet (0.6- 1.8 metres) tall. The ligule is prominent and membranous, &frac14;&nbsp;inch (0.6&nbsp;cm) long and rounded at the apex. The gradually tapering leaf blades are 3&frac12;&ndash;10&nbsp;inches (8.9&ndash;25.4&nbsp;cm) long, &frac14;&ndash;&frac34; inch (0.6&ndash;1.9&nbsp;cm) wide, flat, and often harsh on both surfaces. The compact panicles are erect or sometimes slightly spreading and range from 3&ndash;16&nbsp;inches (7.6&ndash;40.6&nbsp;cm) long with branches &frac12;&ndash;1&frac12; inches (1.2&ndash;3.8&nbsp;cm) long. Single flowers occur in dense clusters in May to mid-June or August. Inflorescences are green or slightly purple at first, then become tan.<br /><br />The seeds are shiny brown. The seed is used as bird food and is generally mixed with rapeseed and other seeds that cheapen it. It should be kept in a dry place and away from vermin. Industrially, a flour made from seed is employed in the manufacture of fine cotton goods and silk stuffs.<br /><br /><em>Phalaris canariensis</em> resembles <em>Phalaris arundinacea</em> (reed canary grass), a perennial forage crop and a wild grass. Although heads of both crops are panicles, <em>Phalaris canariensis</em> heads resemble club wheat.<br /><br />In the Canary Islands, Italy and North Africa, <em>P. canariensis</em> is used as food. In certain parts of Mexico, such as Valle de Bravo, it is prepared and sold by street food vendors as a much appreciated form of atole. However, the seed hulls appear to contain silica fibers, which are linked to esophageal cancer. In 2013, a new hull-less or glabrous variety was announced as a gluten-free food for humans<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It reproduces by rhizomes and seeds.<br /><br />Johnson grass has been used for forage and to stop erosion, but it is often considered a weed because:<ul><li>Foliage that becomes wilted from frost or hot, dry weather can contain sufficient amounts of hydrogen cyanide to kill cattle and horses if it is eaten in quantity.</li><li>The foliage can cause 'bloat' in such herbivores from the accumulation of excessive nitrates; otherwise, it is edible.</li><li>It grows and spreads so quickly, it can 'choke out' other cash crops planted by farmers.</li></ul>This species occurs in crop fields, pastures, abandoned fields, rights-of-way, forest edges, and along streambanks. It thrives in open, disturbed, rich, bottom ground, particularly in cultivated fields. Johnson grass resistant to the common herbicide glyphosate has been found in Argentina and the United States. It is considered to be one of the ten worst weeds in the world.<br /><br />It is named after an Alabama plantation owner, Colonel William Johnson, who sowed its seeds on river-bottom farm land <em>circa</em> 1840. The plant was already established in several US states a decade earlier, having been introduced as a prospective forage or accidentally as a seedlot contaminant.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Both the wild ancestor and location of the original domestication of proso millet are unknown, but it first appears as a crop in both Transcaucasia and China about 7,000 years ago, suggesting it may have been domesticated independently in each area. It is still extensively cultivated in India, Nepal, Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, the Middle East, Turkey and Romania. In the United States, proso is mainly grown for birdseed. It is sold as health food, and due to its lack of gluten, it can be included in the diets of people who cannot tolerate wheat.<br /><br />The name comes from the pan-Slavic general and generic name for millet (Russian, Ukrainian, Belarusian, Serbian, Macedonian, Bulgarian: ????? and Polish, Czech, Slovak, Slovenian, Croatian: <em>proso</em>).<br /><br />Proso is well adapted to many soil and climatic conditions; it has a short growing season, and needs little water. The water requirement of proso is probably the lowest of any major cereal. It is an excellent crop for dryland and no-till farming. Proso millet is an annual grass whose plants reach an average height of 100&nbsp;cm (4 feet.). Like corn, it has a C4 photosynthesis. The seedheads grow in bunches. The seeds are small (2&ndash;3&nbsp;mm or 0.1 inch) and can be cream, yellow, orange-red, or brown in colour.<br /><br />Proso is an annual grass like all other millets, but it is not closely related to pearl millet, foxtail millet, finger millet, or the barnyard millets.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Common names include <strong>Yorkshire fog</strong>, <strong>tufted grass</strong>, and <strong>meadow soft grass</strong>. In North America, where it is an invasive species, names include <strong>velvet grass</strong> and <strong>common velvet grass</strong>.<br /><br />In parts of northern Europe the grass is a common native species and a hardy pasture grass.<br /><br /><em>Holcus lanatus</em> has velvety grey-green leaves. The stems are round. The bases of the stems are white with pink stripes or veins; this character has been called the 'stripy pyjamas'. The inflorescence is robust and often tinged purple. It produces a large amount of seed and is a rapid coloniser of disturbed ground. It prefers wetter ground; it is often seen around drainage ditches. The ligule is 1&ndash;4 millimetres (0.039&ndash;0.157&nbsp;in) long, blunt, and hairy.<br /><br />This species can be distinguished from <em>H. mollis</em> by the beardless nodes on its culm, the absence of rhizomes, and the awn becoming hooked when dry and not projecting beyond the tips of the glumes. It has been known to hybridize with <em>H. mollis</em>, producing a male sterile hybrid with 2<em>n</em> = 21 chromosomes. Hybrids tend to resemble <em>H. lanatus</em> in their morphology.<br /><br />It spreads vegetatively by developing new shoots and roots at its nodes. Plants form a blanket of runners on the soil surface. Semi-prostrate rosettes of shoots called 'mops' may form at the end of the runners. These mops root readily in contact with moist soil.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Arundo donax</strong></em>, <strong>giant cane</strong>, is a tall perennial cane growing in damp soils, either fresh or moderately saline. It is one of the several species of the so-called reed. Other common names include <strong>Carrizo</strong>, <strong>Arundo</strong>, <strong>Spanish cane</strong>, <strong>Colorado river reed</strong>, <strong>wild cane</strong>, and <strong>giant reed</strong>.<br /><br /><em>Arundo donax</em> is native to the Mediterranean Basin and middle east Asia, and probably also parts of Africa and southern Arabian Peninsula. It has been widely planted and naturalised in the mild temperate, subtropical and tropical regions of both hemispheres (Herrera &amp; Dudley 2003), especially in the Mediterranean, California, the western Pacific and the Caribbean. It forms dense stands on disturbed sites, sand dunes, in wetlands and riparian habitats.<br /><br /><em>Arundo donax</em> generally grows to 6 metres (20&nbsp;ft), in ideal conditions it can exceed 10 metres (33&nbsp;ft), with hollow stems 2 to 3 centimetres (0.79 to 1.18&nbsp;in) diameter. The leaves are alternate, 30 to 60 centimetres (12 to 24&nbsp;in) long and 2 to 6 centimetres (0.79 to 2.36&nbsp;in) wide with a tapered tip, grey-green, and have a hairy tuft at the base. Overall, it resembles an outsize common reed (<em>Phragmites australis</em>) or a bamboo (subfamily Bambusoideae).<br /><br /><em>Arundo donax</em> flowers in late summer, bearing upright, feathery plumes 40 to 60 centimetres (16 to 24&nbsp;in) long, that are usually seedless or with seeds that are rarely fertile. Instead, it mostly reproduces vegetatively, by underground rhizomes. The rhizomes are tough and fibrous and form knotty, spreading mats that penetrate deep into the soil up to 1 metre (3.3&nbsp;ft) deep (Alden et al., 1998; Mackenzie, 2004). Stem and rhizome pieces less than 5 centimetres (2.0&nbsp;in) long and containing a single node readily sprouted under a variety of conditions (Boose and Holt, 1999). This vegetative growth appears to be well adapted to floods, which may break up individual <em>A. donax</em> clumps, spreading the pieces, which may sprout and colonise further downstream<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The bristly spikelets are 2 to 3 centimeters long, not counting the bent awn which is up to 4 centimeters in length. <em>Avena barbata</em> largely reproduces by selfing in natural populations, with very low rates of outcrossing.<br /><br /><em>A. barbata</em> is native to central Asia (as far east as Pakistan) and the Mediterranean Basin. As an introduced species it also occurs in other Mediterranean-like habitats of New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, Argentina, Chile, Brazil, and Uruguay. In Europe it has been reported in Finland, France, Germany, Norway, Bulgaria, and Austria. In North America it is an introduced species and noxious weed, where it is especially widespread in California. In California it has displaced native species of grass.

The membranous ligule is prominent, white in color with spiky hairs. The wide panicle nods like that of an oat plant, and it bears a large, splayed spikelet with a very long awn which can exceed five centimeters in length. The seeds easily break out of the spikelet. They are very sharp and very rough due to tiny barb-like hairs that face backwards, allowing the seed to catch and lodge like a fish hook. This characteristic makes the seeds a danger to animals, which can easily get a seed lodged in a paw or eye. Motion can cause the seed to work itself deeply into flesh. This is one of several grass species known to pet owners as 'foxtails', a backyard hazard for outdoor cats and dogs.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Festuca arundinacea</strong></em> (syn., <em><strong>Schedonorus arundinaceus</strong></em> and <em><strong>Lolium arundinaceum</strong></em>) is a species of grass commonly known as <strong>tall fescue</strong>. It is a cool-season perennial C<sub>3</sub> species of bunchgrass native to Europe. It is an important forage grass throughout Europe, and many cultivars have been used in agriculture. It is also an ornamental grass in gardens, and a phytoremediation plant.<br /><br />The predominant cultivar found in British pastures is S170, an endophyte-free variety. In its native European environment, tall fescue is found in damp grasslands, river banks, and in coastal seashore locations. Its distribution is a factor of climatic, edaphic, or other environmental attributes.<br /><br />Tall fescue is a long-lived perennial bunchgrass species. Photosynthesis occurs throughout the leaves, which form bunches and are thick and wide with prominent veins running parallel the entire length of the blade. The blades have a 'toothed' edge which can be felt if fingers are run down the edge of the leaf blade. The underside of the leaf may be shiny. Emerging leaves are rolled in the bud with no prominent ligule. Note that most grasses are folded not rolled, which make this a key identification feature on tall fescue. The auricles are usually blunt but occasionally may be more clawlike. The culm is round in cross-section. Typically, this species of grass has a long growing season and ranges between 2 and 4 feet (1.2&nbsp;m) tall in seedhead stage.<br /><br />Tall fescue spreads through tillering and seed transmission &mdash; not by stolons or rhizomes, which are common in many grass species. However, tall fescue may have numerous sterile shoots that extend the width of each bunch. There are approximately 227,000 seeds per pound.<sup>[7]</sup><br /><br />Typically found across the mid-Atlantic and Southeast US, tall fescue performs best in soils with pH values between 5.5 and 7. Growth may occur year-round if conditions are adequate, but typically growth ceases when soil temperature falls below 40&nbsp;&deg;F (4&nbsp;&deg;C).<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Though <em>P. annua</em> is commonly considered a solely annual plant due to its name, perennial bio-types do exist. <em>Poa</em> (&pi;?&alpha;) is Greek for 'fodder'. It is one of the sweetest grasses for green fodder, but less useful than hay. This grass may have originated as a hybrid between <em>Poa supina</em> and <em>Poa infirma</em>.<br /><br />It has a slightly creeping, fibrous, rootstock. The stem grows from 15&ndash;25&nbsp;cm high. It is slightly flattened, due to being folded rather than rolled.<br /><br />The panicle is open and triangular shaped, 5 to 7.5&nbsp;cm long. The spikelets are stalked, awnless, 1 to 2&nbsp;cm long when flowering, and loosely arranged on delicate paired or spreading branches. Sometimes they are tinged purple.<br /><br />The vivid green leaves are short and blunt at the tips, shaped like the prow of a small canoe. They are soft and drooping. Long sheaths clasp the stem. The leaves are smooth above and below, with finely serrated edges. Occasionally the leaves are serrated transversely.<br /><br />The ligule is pointed and silvery. Compared this to Common Meadowgrass <em>Poa pratensis</em>, which has a squared ligule, and <em>Poa trivialis</em>, which has a pointed, but less silvery ligule.<br /><br />The leaves are smooth above and below, with finely serrated edges. Occasionally the leaves are serrated transversely.<br /><br />It is in flower all year around except for severe winters. The seeds ripen and are deposited 8 months of the year. The plant grows rapidly from seed, flowering within 6 weeks, seeding and then dying.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Poa bulbosa</strong></em> is a species of grass known by the common names <strong>bulbous bluegrass</strong> or <strong>bulbous meadow-grass</strong>. It is native to Eurasia and North Africa, but it is present practically worldwide as an introduced species. It is widespread in the United States and southern Canada. It was introduced to the eastern United States around 1906 and the western US in 1915 as a contaminant in shipments of alfalfa seed. It was intentionally planted on both the east and west coasts to control weeds and prevent erosion. Today it is a common grass across the continent and is a noxious weed in some areas. It is a sturdy, hardy, persistent, aggressive grass that easily outcompetes many other plants and becomes the dominant species in disturbed habitat types, such as overgrazed fields.<br /><br />This is an annual or perennial grass forming dense clumps up to about 60 centimeters tall. The stems are smooth and hollow and usually have bulbous sections at their bases about a centimeter in length. The grass is more likely to have bulbous sections if it is growing in a drier area, and study has indicated the bulbous sections are mostly water. If the bulbous bases are detached and replanted they can give rise to new plants. The inflorescence is a wide cluster of branches bearing green leaflike spikelets with darker bases that contain bulbils. Viable seed is rarely produced, and the plant usually reproduces asexually via its basal bulbous sections and via bulbils. Although the plant reproduces vegetatively (asexaully) most of the time, it has been shown to possess high genetic variability.<br /><br />Many types of animals, including wild and domesticated ruminants, small mammals, and birds, readily consume this grass, especially the bulbils in the inflorescences, which contain some starches and fats. The grass is used as a fodder and a pasture grass in parts of its native region.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The only currently fully accepted species is <em><strong>Chamaerops humilis</strong></em>, variously called <strong>European fan palm</strong>, or the <strong>Mediterranean dwarf palm</strong>. It is one of the most cold-hardy palms used in landscaping in temperate climates.<br /><br /><em>Chamaerops humilis</em> is a shrub-like clumping palm, with several stems growing from a single base. It has an underground rhizome which produces shoots with palmate, sclerophyllous leaves. It is an especially fire tolerant species, common on sites which are frequently burnt.<br /><br />The stems grow slowly and often tightly together, eventually reaching 2&ndash;5&nbsp;m (10&ndash;20&nbsp;ft) tall with a trunk diameter of 20&ndash;25&nbsp;cm (8&ndash;10&nbsp;in). It is a fan palm (Arecaceae tribe Corypheae), and as such, has leaves with petioles terminating in rounded fans of 10&ndash;20 leaflets. Each leaf is up to 1.5&nbsp;m (5&nbsp;ft) long, with leaflets 50&ndash;80&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;30&nbsp;in) long. The petioles are armed with numerous sharp, needle-like spines; these may protect the stem growing point from browsing animals.<br /><br />The flowers are borne in dense, short inflorescences at the tops of the stems. The plants usually, but not invariably, are dioecious with male and female flowers on separate plants. The prophyll covers the flowers on the inflorescence until the sexual phase (anthesis) and then splits open apically into two triangular lobes. The number of flowers per inflorescence is highly variable for both male and female plants, depending on the size of the inflorescence. Female flowers are tri-ovulate. Unripe fruits are bright green, turning to dull yellow to brown as they ripen during autumn (September&ndash;November). The seed (usually 0.6&ndash;0.8&nbsp;g or <sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>50</sub>&ndash;<sup>3</sup>&frasl;<sub>100</sub>&nbsp;oz) contains a small cylindrical embryo, which is surrounded by several layers, from inner to outer as follows:<ul><li>a nutritious endosperm,</li><li>a wide woody layer or endocarp,</li><li>a fleshy and fibrous mesocarp (the pulp), and</li><li>the thin outer layer or exocarp.</li></ul><em>Chamaerops humilis</em> is one of only two palm species native to southern Europe, the other being <em>Phoenix theophrasti</em>. It is mainly found in southwestern Europe (Malta, Sicily, Sardinia, over all the Mediterranean coast of Spain and Portugal, central and southern Italy, some parts of the southern Mediterranean coast of France and Monaco, as well as northwest Africa (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia).<sup>[4]</sup><sup>[8]</sup> It is the northernmost naturally occurring palm in the world, with the northernmost standing at Hy&egrave;res-les-Palmiers, at 43&deg; 07&prime; N.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

It is a relative of <em>Phoenix dactylifera</em>, the true date palm. It is the natural symbol of the Canary Islands, together with the canary <em>Serinus canaria</em>. Mature <em>P. canariensis</em> are often used in the ornamental landscape and are collected and transplanted to their new planting location. A Canary Island Date Palm with 30 feet of trunk is approximately 60 years of age.<br /><br /><em>Phoenix canariensis</em> is a large solitary palm, 10&ndash;20&nbsp;m (33&ndash;66&nbsp;ft) tall, occasionally growing to 40&nbsp;m (131&nbsp;ft). The leaves are pinnate, 4&ndash;6&nbsp;m (13&ndash;20&nbsp;ft) long, with 80&ndash;100 leaflets on each side of the central rachis. The fruit is an oval, yellow to orange drupe 2&nbsp;cm (0.79&nbsp;in) long and 1&nbsp;cm (0.39&nbsp;in) in diameter and containing a single large seed; the fruit pulp is edible but too thin to be worth eating.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<em><strong>Helicodiceros muscivorus</strong></em> (<strong>dead horse arum lily</strong>) is an ornamental plant native to Corsica, Sardinia and the Balearic Islands. It is the only species in the genus <em><strong>Helicodiceros</strong></em>. Within the Araceae family the plant is part of the Aroideae subfamily.<br /><br />The flowers of <em>H. muscivorus</em> smell like rotting meat, attracting carrion-seeking blow flies which act as pollinators. One of a rare group of thermogenic plants, the dead horse arum can raise its temperature by thermogenesis. This helps to lure flies into the plant to contact its pollen. The plant still is being studied for the way it is able to produce its own heat without being necessarily dependent of ambient temperature.<br /><br />The inflorescence of the arum lilies is a three-part spadix which resembles the anal area of a dead mammal. In between is a hairy spathe such as a &lsquo;tail&rsquo; running down into the chamber of the flower which bonds with the fertile male and female florets. The appendix and the male florets are thermogenic, but have different temporal patterns. The exits of the female florets are hindered by spines and filaments which serve to trap the blow flies once inside. The male florets exhibit independence from the ambient temperatures as heat production depends on the time of the day rather than ambient temperatures. Also, uncoupling protein was found in both the thermionic male florets and the appendix. The protein is 1178 nucleotide in length in the dead horse arum mRNA excluding the poly-A tail and it is believed to have a protein of 304 amino acids. It also possesses three mitochondrial carrier signature domains, six membrane-spanning domains, and one nucleotide-binding domain. Potato and rice have been compared to the plant at times due to its typical features of the uncoupling protein. Uncoupling protein plays a role in the production of energy to become heat.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

In Canada, broadleaf cattail occurs in all provinces and also in the Yukon and Northwest Territories, and in the United States, it is native to all states except Hawaii. It is an introduced and invasive species, and considered a noxious weed, in Australia and Hawaii. It is not native but has been reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines.<br/><br/><em>Typha latifolia </em>has been found in a variety of climates, including tropical, subtropical, southern and northern temperate, humid coastal, and dry continental. It is found at elevations from sea level to 7,500 feet (2,300 m).<br/><br/><em>Typha latifolia</em> is an 'obligate wetland' species, meaning that it is always found in or near water. The species generally grows in flooded areas where the water depth does not exceed 2.6 feet (0.8 meters). However, it has also been reported growing in floating mats in slightly deeper water. <em>T. latifolia </em>grows mostly in fresh water but also occurs in slightly brackish marshes.The species can displace other species native to salt marshes upon reduction in salinity. Under such conditions the plant may be considered invasive, since it interferes with preservation of the salt marsh habitat.<br/><br/><em>Typha latifolia </em>shares its range with other related species, and hybridizes with <em>Typha angustifolia</em>, narrow-leaf cattail, to form <em>Typha × glauca (Typha angustifolia × T. latifolia)</em>, white cattail.

Most of the leaves of <em>S.&nbsp;lacustris</em> are reduced to bladeless sheaths around the stem, but leaf blades up to 100 centimetres (39&nbsp;in) long can be formed under water. The inflorescence appears at the top of the stem, and comprises 3&ndash;10 branches, each of which is up to 10&nbsp;cm (3.9&nbsp;in) long and may be again divided into shorter branches. The flowers are in the form of spikelets, each of which is 6&ndash;15 millimetres (0.24&ndash;0.59&nbsp;in) long by 3&ndash;5&nbsp;mm (0.12&ndash;0.20&nbsp;in) wide.<br /><br />The stems of <em>S.&nbsp;lacustris</em> are round in cross-section, in contrast to the triquetrous (rounded-triangular) stems of other species in the genus, such as <em>S.&nbsp;triqueter</em> and <em>S.&nbsp;pungens</em>. The stems of <em>S.&nbsp;tabernaemontani</em> are also round, but <em>S.&nbsp;tabernaemontani</em> is a smaller plant, less than 1.5&nbsp;m (4&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) tall, with only two stigmas per flower.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

Recent studies by taxonomists of the Cyperaceae have resulted in the creation of several new genera, including the genera <em>Schoenoplectus</em> and <em>Bolboschoenus</em>; others (including <em>Blysmus</em>, <em>Isolepis</em>, <em>Nomochloa</em>, and <em>Scirpoides</em>) have also been used. At one point this genus held almost 300 species, but many of the species once assigned to it have now been reassigned, and it now holds an estimated 120 species.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The leaves are reduced to scales and, although Limodorum contains photosynthetic pigments, these are insufficient to support the nutrition of the adult plant which is believed to rely entirely on a mycoheterotrophic or parasitic relationship with fungi, primarily of the family Russulaceae. Seeds are among the largest produced by orchids and seedlings develop very slowly, remaining entirely below ground for 8-10 years before flowering.<br /><br />Typical Mediterranean habitat for <em>Limodorum abortivum</em> is open woodland of evergreen oak, pine and chestnut from sea level to 1,300 metres.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

The lip is three-lobed and bordered by a greenish-yellow border which is surrounded by a band of thick velvety hairs which are reddish brown. The sepals and petals are green and marked with violet spots or stripes.<br /><br />Ophrys speculum is spread throughout the Mediterranean region, and is particularly prolific in the Algarve region of Portugal. It becomes more scarce in the east. Other countries in Europe where this orchid is known to occur include Spain, Cyprus and Greece.

Males are lured by the flower, which resembles the female wasp. The flower and wasp are both hairy and the blue patch on the lip appears to mimic the reflection of the sky on the wasp&rsquo;s wings. Moreover, the floral scent resembles the mating pheromones of the female wasps, and males become highly excited and try to copulate with the flowers, pollinating them in the process.<br /><br />(From Wikipedia)",

This includes Iran, Russia, Kazakhstan, Turkey, Algeria, India, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, France, Spain and many other countries.  The flowers are pollinated by solitary bees. The flowers produce little nectar and the yellowish dust on the labellum which the insects collect is of little nutritional value. The actual pollen is contained in two pollinia which adhere to the hairs on the bee's back. The flower spikes are eaten by deer.  Sword-leaved Helleborine usually grows in damp woodland places (mainly oak and beech), forest edges and rocky slopes.

			"Commonname": "Ruddy Duck",
			"Genus": "Oxyura",
			"species": "jamaicensis",
			"Description": "The ruddy duck (<i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i>) is a duck from North America and the Andes Mountains of South America, one of the stiff-tailed ducks. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek <i>oxus</i>, ‘sharp’, and <i>oura</i>, ‘tail’, and <i>jamaicensis</i> is Jamaica. <br/><br/>These are small, compact ducks with stout, scoop-shaped bills, and long, stiff tails they often hold cocked upward. They have slightly peaked heads and fairly short, thick necks. Male Ruddy Ducks have blackish caps that contrast with bright white cheeks. In summer, they have rich chestnut bodies with bright blue bills. In winter, they are dull gray-brown above and paler below with dull gray bills. Females and first-year males are brownish, somewhat like winter males but with a blurry stripe across the pale cheek patch. In flight, Ruddy Ducks show solidly dark tops of the wings.<br/><br/>The southern subspecies <i>ferruginea</i> is occasionally considered a distinct species. It is separable by its all-black face and larger size. The subspecies <i>andina</i> has a varying amount of black coloration on its white face; it may in fact be nothing more than a hybrid population between the North American and the Andean ruddy duck. As the Colombian population is becoming scarce, it is necessary to clarify its taxonomic status, because it would be relevant for conservation purposes.<br/><br/>Their breeding habitat is marshy lakes and ponds. They nest in dense marsh vegetation near water. The female builds the nest out of grass, locating it in tall vegetation to hide it from predators. A typical brood contains 5 to 15 ducklings. Pairs form each year. <br/><br/>They are migratory and winter in coastal bays and unfrozen lakes and ponds. <br/><br/>These birds dive and swim underwater. They mainly eat seeds and roots of aquatic plants, aquatic insects and crustaceans. <br/><br/>Ruddy ducks were imported into the UK in 1948 by conservationist Sir Peter Scott. As a result of escapes from wildfowl collections in the late 1950s, they became established in Great Britain, from where they spread into Europe. By the year 2000, the population had increased to around 6,000 individuals. This duck's aggressive courting behavior and willingness to interbreed with the endangered native white-headed duck (<i>Oxyura leucocephala</i>), of southern Europe, caused concern amongst Spanish conservationists. Due to this, a controversial scheme to extirpate the ruddy duck as a British breeding species started; there have also been culling attempts in other European countries. By early 2014, the cull had reduced the British population to about 20–100, down from a peak of about 5500 in 2000 <br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

			"Description": "The white-headed duck (<i>Oxyura leucocephala</i>) is a small stiff-tailed duck some 45 cm (18 in) long. The male has a white head with black crown, a blue bill, and reddish-grey plumage. The female has a dark bill and rather duller colouring. Its breeding habitat is lakes with open water and dense vegetation at the margin. It dives under water and feeds on aquatic vegetation as well as some animal matter. It is more likely to swim away from a perceived threat than to fly. This duck is known from Spain, North Africa, western and central Asia. Populations are declining, mostly due to loss of habitat and hunting, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's status as ‘endangered‘.<br/><br/>Adult males have a grey and reddish body, a blue bill and a largely white head with a black cap and neck. Adult females have a grey-brown body with a white face and a darker bill, cap, and cheek stripe. Length is 43–48 cm (17–19 in) and weight is 580–750 g<br/><br/>This duck breeds in Spain and North Africa, with a larger population in western and central Asia. Their breeding habitat is large tracts of open water with dense stands of aquatic plants to provide cover and nesting sites. Individuals are fairly frequently reported well north of their breeding range, but as with many wildfowl, the status of these extralimital records is clouded by the possibility of escapes from collections. <br/><br/>These birds dive and swim under water. They are omnivorous, with vegetable matter predominating. They are reluctant to fly, preferring to swim for cover. <br/><br/>This duck is considered endangered due to a large reduction in populations in the last 10 years. Most of this decline is due to habitat loss and hunting, but interbreeding of the Spanish population with the introduced ruddy duck (<i>Oxyura jamaicensis</i>) is a more recent threat. This has led to the attempted eradication of the American species from western Europe. <br/><br/>The white-headed duck is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated the bird's conservation status as being ‘endangered‘.<br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

			"Order": "Anseriformes",
			"Family": "Anatidae",
			"Commonname": "Mute Swan",
			"Genus": "Cygnus",
			"species": "olor",
			"Description": "The mute swan (<i>Cygnus olor</i>) is a species of swan and a member of the waterfowl family Anatidae. It is native to much of Eurasia, and (as a rare winter visitor) the far north of Africa. It is an introduced species in North America, Australasia and southern Africa. The name 'mute' derives from it being less vocal than other swan species. Measuring 125 to 170 cm (49 to 67 in) in length, this large swan is wholly white in plumage with an orange beak bordered with black. It is recognisable by its pronounced knob atop the beak, which is larger in males.<br/><br/>Adults of this large swan typically range from 140 to 160 cm (55 to 63 in) long, although can range in extreme cases from 125 to 170 cm (49 to 67 in), with a 200 to 240 cm (79 to 94 in) wingspan. Males are larger than females and have a larger knob on their bill. On average, this is the second largest waterfowl species after the trumpeter swan, although male mute swans can easily match or even exceed a male trumpeter in mass. Among standard measurements of the mute swan, the wing chord measures 53–62.3 cm (20.9–24.5 in), the tarsus is 10–11.8 cm (3.9–4.6 in) and the bill is 6.9–9 cm (2.7–3.5 in). <br/><br/>The mute swan is one of the heaviest flying birds. In several studies from Great Britain, males (known as cobs) were found to average from about 10.6 to 11.87 kg (23.4 to 26.2 lb), with a weight range of 9.2–14.3 kg (20–32 lb) while the slightly smaller females (known as pens) averaged about 8.5 to 9.67 kg (18.7 to 21.3 lb), with a weight range of 7.6–10.6 kg (17–23 lb). While the top normal weight for a big cob is roughly 15 kg (33 lb), one unusually big Polish cob weighed almost 23 kg (51 lb) and this counts as the largest weight ever verified for a flying bird, although it has been questioned whether this heavyweight could still take flight. <br/><br/>Young birds, called cygnets, are not the bright white of mature adults, and their bill is dull greyish-black, not orange, for the first year. The down may range from pure white to grey to buff, with grey/buff the most common. The white cygnets have a leucistic gene. Cygnets grow quickly, reaching a size close to their adult size in approximately three months after hatching. Cygnets typically retain their grey feathers until they are at least one year old, with the down on their wings having been replaced by Flight feathers earlier that year. <br/><br/>All mute swans are white at maturity, though the feathers (particularly on the head and neck) are often stained orange-brown by iron and tannins in the water. <br/><br/>The morph <i>immutabilis </i>('Polish swan') has pinkish (not dark grey) legs and dull white cygnets; as with white domestic geese, it is only found in populations with a history of domestication. Polish swans carry a copy of a gene responsible for leucism. <br/><br/>The mute swan is found naturally mainly in temperate areas of Europe across western Asia, as far east as the Russian Maritimes, near Sidemi. <br/><br/>It is partially migratory throughout northern latitudes in Europe and Asia, as far south as north Africa and the Mediterranean. It is known and recorded to have nested in Iceland and is a vagrant to that area, as well as to Bermuda, according to the UN Environment Programme chart of international status chart of bird species, which places it in 70 countries, breeding in 49 countries, and vagrant in 16 countries. While most of the current population in Japan is introduced, mute swans are depicted on scrolls more than a thousand years old, and wild birds from the mainland Asian population still occur rarely in winter. Natural migrants to Japan usually occur along with whooper and sometimes Bewick's swans. <br/><br/>The mute swan is protected in most of its range, but this has not prevented illegal hunting and poaching. It is often kept in captivity outside its natural range, as a decoration for parks and ponds, and escapes have happened. The descendants of such birds have become naturalised in the eastern United States and Great Lakes, much as the Canada goose has done in Europe.",

			"Commonname": "Tundra Swan",
			"Genus": "Cygnus",
			"species": "columbianus",
			"Description": "The tundra swan (<i>Cygnus columbianus</i>) is a small Holarctic swan. The two taxa within it are usually regarded as conspecific, but are also sometimes split into two species: Bewick's swan (<i>Cygnus bewickii</i>) of the Palaearctic and the whistling swan (<i>C. columbianus</i>) proper of the Nearctic. Birds from eastern Russia (roughly east of the Taimyr Peninsula) are sometimes separated as the subspecies <i>C. c. jankowskii</i>, but this is not widely accepted as distinct, most authors including them in <i>C. c. bewickii</i>. Tundra swans are sometimes separated in the genus <i>Olor</i> together with the other Arctic swan species.<br/><br/>Bewick's swan was named in 1830 by William Yarrell after the engraver Thomas Bewick, who specialised in illustrations of birds and animals. Cygnus is the Latin for ‘swan’, and <i>columbianus</i> comes from the Columbia River, the type locality.‘<br/><br/><i>C. columbianus</i> is the smallest of the Holarctic swans, at 115–150 cm (45–59 in) in length, 168–211 cm (66–83 in) in wingspan and a weight range of 3.4–9.6 kg (7.5–21.2 lb). In adult birds, the plumage of both subspecies is entirely white, with black feet, and a bill that is mostly black, with a thin salmon-pink streak running along the mouthline and – depending on the subspecies – more or less yellow in the proximal part. The iris is dark brown. In birds living in waters that contains large amounts of iron ions (e.g. bog lakes), the head and neck plumage acquires a golden or rusty hue. Pens (females) are slightly smaller than cobs (males), but do not differ in appearance otherwise.<br/><br/>Immatures of both subspecies are white mixed with some dull grey feathering, mainly on the head and upper neck, which are often entirely light grey; their first-summer plumage is quite white already, and in their second winter they moult into the adult plumage. Their bills are black with a large dirty-pink patch taking up most of the proximal half and often black nostrils, and their feet are dark grey with a pinkish hue. Downy young are silvery grey above and white below.<br/><br/>Bewick's swans are the smaller subspecies. There is a slight size cline, with the eastern birds being slightly larger; good measurement data only exists for the western populations however. These weigh 3.4–7.8 kg (7.5–17.2 lb), 6.4 kg (14 lb) on average in males and 5.7 kg (13 lb) in females. They measure 115–140 cm (45–55 in) in overall length; each wing is 46.9–54.8 cm (18.5–21.6 in) long, on average 51.9 cm (20.4 in) in males and 50.4 cm (19.8 in) in females. The tarsus measures 9.2–11.6 cm (3.6–4.6 in) in length, the bill 8.2–10.2 cm (3.2–4.0 in), averaging 9.1 cm (3.6 in). Bewick's swan is similar in appearance to the parapatric whooper swan (<i>C. Cygnus</i>), but is smaller, shorter-necked and has a more rounded head shape, with variable bill pattern, but always showing more black than yellow and having a blunt forward edge of the yellow base patch. Whooper swans have a bill that has more yellow than black and the forward edge of the yellow patch is usually pointed. The bill pattern for every individual Bewick's swan is unique, and scientists often make detailed drawings of each bill and assign names to the swans to assist with studying these birds. The eastern birds, apart from being larger, tend towards less yellow on the bill, perhaps indicating that gene flow across Beringia, while marginal, never entirely ceased. An apparent case of hybridization between a Bewick's and a vagrant whistling swan has been reported from eastern Siberia.<br/><br/>Whistling swans weigh 9.5–21 lb (4.3–9.5 kg) – 16 lb (7.3 kg) on average in males and 14 lb (6.4 kg) in females –, and measure 47–59 in (120–150 cm) in length. Each wing is 19.7–22.4 in (50–57 cm) long; the tarsus measures 3.7–4.5 in (9.4–11.4 cm) in length, and the bill is 3.6–4.2 in (9.1–10.7 cm) long. <i>C. c. columbianus </i>is distinguished from <i>C. c. bewickii </i>by its larger size and the mostly black bill, with just a small and usually hard to see yellow spot of variable size at the base. It is distinguished from the largely allopatric trumpeter swan (<i>C. buccinators</i>) of North America by that species' much larger size and particularly long bill, which is black all over except for the pink mouthline, which is stronger than in the whistling swan.<br/><br/>Note that color variations with more or less yellow, or pink instead of yellow or black, are not exceptional, especially in Bewick's swans, which very rarely may even have yellowish feet. The small size and particularly the rather short neck, which make it look like a large white goose, are still distinguishing marks.<br/><br/>Tundra swans have high-pitched honking calls and sound similar to a black goose (<i>Branta</i>). They are particularly vocal when foraging in flocks on their wintering grounds; any conspecific arriving or leaving will elicit a bout of loud excited calling from its fellows. Contrary to its common name, the ground calls of the whistling swan are not a whistle and neither notably different from that of Bewick's swan. The flight call of the latter is a low and soft ringing bark, bow-wow...; the whistling swan gives a markedly high-pitched trisyllabic bark like wow-wow-wow in flight. By contrast, the whooper and trumpeter swans' names accurately describe their calls—a deep hooting and a higher-pitched French horn-like honk, respectively. Flying birds of these species are shorter-necked and have a quicker wingbeat than their relatives, but they are often impossible to tell apart except by their calls.<br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

			"Commonname": "Whooper Swan",
			"Genus": "Cygnus",
			"species": "cygnus",
			"Description": "The whooper swan (<i>Cygnus Cygnus</i>), pronounced hooper swan, is a large Northern Hemisphere swan. It is the Eurasian counterpart of the North American trumpeter swan, and the type species for the <i>Cygnus</i> genus. Francis Willughby and John Ray's Ornithology of 1676 referred to this swan as ‘the Elk, Hooper, or wild Swan’. The scientific name is from <i>cygnus</i>, the Latin for ‘swan’.<br/><br/>The whooper swan is similar in appearance to the Bewick's swan. It is larger, however, at a length of 140–165 cm (55–65 in) and a wingspan of 205–275 cm (81–108 in). Weight typically is in the range of 7.4–14 kg (16–31 lb), with an average of 9.8–11.4 kg (22–25 lb) for males and 8.2–9.2 kg (18–20 lb) for females. The verified record mass was 15.5 kg (34 lb) for a wintering male from Denmark. It is considered to be amongst the heaviest flying birds. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 56.2–63.5 cm (22.1–25.0 in), the tarsus is 10.4–13 cm (4.1–5.1 in) and the bill is 9.2–11.6 cm (3.6–4.6 in). It has a more angular head shape and a more variable bill pattern that always shows more yellow than black (Bewick's swans have more black than yellow). Like their close relatives, whooper swans are vocal birds with a call similar to the trumpeter swan.<br/><br/>Whooper swans require large areas of water to live in, especially when they are still growing, because their body weight cannot be supported by their legs for extended periods of time. The whooper swan spends much of its time swimming, straining the water for food, or eating plants that grow on the bottom.<br/><br/>Whooper swans have a deep honking call and, despite their size, are powerful fliers. Whooper swans can migrate hundreds or even thousands of miles to their wintering sites in southern Europe and eastern Asia. They breed in subarctic Eurasia, further south than Bewicks in the taiga zone. They are rare breeders in northern Scotland, particularly in Orkney, and no more than five pairs have bred there in recent years; a handful of pairs have also bred in Ireland in recent years. This bird is an occasional vagrant to the Indian Subcontinent and western North America. Icelandic breeders overwinter in the United Kingdom and Ireland, especially in the wildfowl nature reserves of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust.<br/><br/>Whooper swans pair for life, and their cygnets stay with them all winter; they are sometimes joined by offspring from previous years. Their preferred breeding habitat is wetland, but semi-domesticated birds will build a nest anywhere close to water. Both the male and female help build the nest, and the male will stand guard over the nest while the female incubates. The female will usually lay 4–7 eggs (exceptionally 12). The cygnets hatch after about 36 days and have a grey or brown plumage. The cygnets can fly at an age of 120 to 150 days.<br/><br/>When whooper swans prepare to go on a flight as a flock, they use a variety of signaling movements to communicate with each other. These movements include head bobs, head shakes, and wing flaps and influence whether the flock will take flight and if so, which individual will take the lead. Whooper swans that signaled with these movements in large groups were found to be able to convince their flock to follow them 61% of the time.] In comparison, swans that did not signal were only able to create a following 35% of the time. In most cases, the whooper swan in the flock that makes the most movements (head bobs) is also the swan that initiates the flight of the flock – this initiator swan can be either male or female, but is more likely to be a parent than a cygnet. Additionally, this signaling method may be a way for paired mates to stay together in flight. Observational evidence indicates that a swan whose mate is paying attention to and participates in its partner’s signals will be more likely to follow through with the flight. Thus, if a whooper swan begins initiating flight signals, it will be less likely to actually carry through with the flight if its mate is not paying attention and is therefore less likely to join it.<br/><br/>They are very noisy; the calls are strident, similar to those of Bewick’s swan but more resonant and lower-pitched on average: kloo-kloo-kloo in groups of three or four.<br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

White-morph birds are white except for black wing tips, but blue-morph geese have bluish-grey plumage replacing the white except on the head, neck and tail tip. The immature blue phase is drab or slate-gray with little to no white on the head, neck, or belly. Both snow and blue phases have rose-red feet and legs, and pink bills with black tomia ('cutting edges'), giving them a black 'grin patch'. The colors are not as bright on the feet, legs, and bill of immature birds. The head can be stained rusty-brown from minerals in the soil where they feed. They are very vocal and can often be heard from more than a mile away.<br/><br/>White- and blue-morph birds interbreed and the offspring may be of either morph. These two colors of geese were once thought to be separate species; since they interbreed and are found together throughout their ranges, they are now considered two color phases of the same species. The color phases are genetically controlled. The dark phase results from a single dominant gene and the white phase is homozygous recessive. When choosing a mate, young birds will most often select a mate that resembles their parents' coloring. If the birds were hatched into a mixed pair, they will mate with either color phase. <br/><br/>The species is divided into two subspecies on the basis of size and geography. Size overlap has caused some to question the division. The smaller subspecies, the lesser snow goose (<i>C. c. caerulescens</i>), lives from central northern Canada to the Bering Straits area. The lesser snow goose stands 64 to 79 cm (25 to 31 in) tall and weighs 2.05 to 2.7 kg (4.5 to 6.0 lb). The larger subspecies, the greater snow goose (C. c. atlanticus), nests in northeastern Canada. It averages about 3.2 kg (7.1 lb) and 79 cm (31 in), but can weigh up to 4.5 kg (9.9 lb). The wingspan for both subspecies ranges from 135 to 165 cm (53 to 65 in). Blue-morph birds are rare among the greater snow geese and among eastern populations of the lesser. Source Wikipedia<br/><br/>",

			"Genus": "Anser",
			"species": "anser",
			"Description": "The greylag is the largest and bulkiest of the grey geese of the genus <i>Anser</i>, but is more lightly built and agile than its domestic relative. It has a rotund, bulky body, a thick and long neck, and a large head and bill. It has pink legs and feet, and an orange or pink bill with a white or brown nail (hard horny material at tip of upper mandible). It is 74 to 91 centimetres (29 to 36 in) long with a wing length of 41.2 to 48 centimetres (16.2 to 18.9 in). It has a tail 6.2 to 6.9 centimetres (2.4 to 2.7 in), a bill of 6.4 to 6.9 centimetres (2.5 to 2.7 in) long, and a tarsus of 7.1 to 9.3 centimetres (2.8 to 3.7 in). It weighs 2.16 to 4.56 kilograms (4.8 to 10.1 lb), with a mean weight of around 3.3 kilograms (7.3 lb). The wingspan is 147 to 180 centimetres (58 to 71 in). Males are generally larger than females, with the sexual dimorphism more pronounced in the eastern subspecies rubirostris, which is larger than the nominate subspecies on average.<br/><br/>The plumage of the greylag goose is greyish-brown, with a darker head and paler breast and belly with a variable amount of black spotting. It has a pale grey fore-wing and rump which are noticeable when the bird is in flight or stretches its wings on the ground. It has a white line bordering its upper flanks, and its wing coverts are light-coloured, contrasting with its darker flight feathers. Its plumage is patterned by the pale fringes of the feathers. Juveniles differ mostly in their lack of black-speckling on the breast and belly and by their greyish legs. Adults have a distinctive 'concertina' pattern of folds in the feathers on their necks.<br/><br/>The greylag goose has a loud cackling call similar to that of the domestic goose, 'aahng-ung-ung', uttered on the ground or in flight. There are various subtle variations used under different circumstances, and individual geese seem to be able to identify other known geese by their voices. The sound made by a flock of geese resembles the baying of hounds. Goslings chirp or whistle lightly, and adults hiss if threatened or angered.",

			"Description": "The lesser white-fronted goose (<i>Anser erythropus</i>) is a goose closely related to the larger white-fronted goose (<i>A. albifrons</i>). It breeds in northernmost Asia, but it is a scarce breeder in Europe. There is a re-introduction scheme in Fennoscandia. The scientific name comes from anser, the Latin for 'goose', and erythropus, 'red-footed', derived from the old Greek eruthros 'red' and pous 'foot'.<br/><br/>The lesser white-fronted goose winters further south in Europe and is a rare winter vagrant to Great Britain, and India.  Individual birds formerly appeared regularly at WWT Slimbridge in Gloucestershire, England, where they inspired Sir Peter Scott to set up The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust—modern records, however, are far less frequent, a consequence of the species' decline on its European breeding grounds. An attractive species, it is also widely kept in wildfowl collections and, as a result, escapes do occur; individuals seen in summer, or in the company of other feral geese, are likely to be of captive origin.<br/><br/>The two white-fronted goose species differ little other than in size (the lesser, at 53–66 cm (21–26 in) length and with a 120–135 cm (47–53 in) wingspan, is not much bigger than a mallard (<i>Anas platyrhynchos</i>) but both may be readily distinguished from the greylag goose by their bright orange legs and their mouse-coloured upper wing-coverts. The greylag goose has a flesh-coloured bill and legs, and the upper wing-coverts are bluish-grey.<br/><br/>Both white-front species have a very conspicuous white face and broad black bars which cross the belly.<br/><br/>Adult lesser white-fronted geese, as well as being smaller than white-fronted geese, have an obvious yellow eye-ring, and the white facial blaze goes up to the crown. <br/><br/>The lesser white-fronted goose is considered an endangered species, but there are programmes to reintroduce animals into the wild to strengthen the population. Additionally it is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Somateria",
			"species": "mollissima",
			"Description": "The common eider is both the largest of the four eider species and the largest duck found in Europe and in North America (except for the Muscovy duck which only reaches North America in a wild state in southernmost Texas and south Florida). It measures 50 to 71 cm (20 to 28 in) in length, weighs 0.81 to 3.04 kg (1.8 to 6.7 lb) and spans 80–110 cm (31–43 in) across the wings. The average weight of 22 males in the North Atlantic was 2.21 kg (4.9 lb) while 32 females weighed an average of 1.92 kg (4.2 lb). It is characterized by its bulky shape and large, wedge-shaped bill. The male is unmistakable, with its black and white plumage and green nape. The female is a brown bird, but can still be readily distinguished from all ducks, except other eider species, on the basis of size and head shape. The drake's display call is a strange almost human-like 'ah-ooo,' while the hen utters hoarse quacks. The species is often readily approachable.<br/><br/>Drakes of the European, eastern North American and Asia/western North American races can be distinguished by minor differences in plumage and bill colour. Some authorities place the subspecies v-nigra as a separate species.<br/><br/>This species dives for crustaceans and molluscs, with mussels being a favoured food. The eider will eat mussels by swallowing them whole; the shells are then crushed in their gizzard and excreted. When eating a crab, the eider will remove all of its claws and legs, and then eat the body in a similar fashion.<br/><br/>It is abundant, with populations of about 1.5–2 million birds in both North America and Europe, and also large but unknown numbers in eastern Siberia (HBW).<br/><br/>A particularly famous colony of eiders lives on the Farne Islands in Northumberland, England. These birds were the subject of one of the first ever bird protection laws, established by Saint Cuthbert in the year 676. About 1,000 pairs still nest there every year. Because St. Cuthbert is the patron saint of Northumberland, it was natural that the eider should be chosen as the county's emblem bird; the birds are still often called Cuddy's ducks in the area, 'Cuddy' being the familiar form of 'Cuthbert'.<br/><br/>In Canada's Hudson Bay, important eider die-offs were observed in the 1990s by local populations due to quickly changing ice flow patterns. The Canadian Wildlife Service has spent several years gathering up-to-date information on their populations, and preliminary results seem to show a population recovery. The common eider is the object of the 2011 documentary People of a Feather, which studies the historical relationship between the Sanikiluaq community and eiders, as well as various aspects of their ecology. The director/cinematographer/biologist, Joel Heath, spent seven years on the project and wrote biological articles on the common eider.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is widespread and common in Eurasia, mainly breeding in temperate and wintering in subtropical regions; in winter, it can also be found in the Maghreb. Its scientific name comes from the French name Tadorne for this species. It may originally derive from Celtic roots meaning 'pied waterfowl', essentially the same as the English 'shelduck'.<br/><br/>Fossil bones from Dorkovo (Bulgaria) described as Balcanas pliocaenica may actually belong to this species. More likely, they are an extinct species of Tadorna (if not a distinct genus) due to their Early Pliocene age; the present species is not unequivocally attested from the fossil record until some 2–3 million years later (Late Pliocene/Early Pleistocene). <br/><br/>The common shelduck resembles a small short-necked goose in size and shape. It is a striking bird, with a reddish-pink bill, pink feet, a white body with chestnut patches and a black belly, and a dark green head and neck. The wing coverts are white, the primary remiges black, and the secondaries green (only showing in flight) and chestnut. The underwings are almost entirely white. Sexes are similar, but the female is smaller, with some white facial markings, while the male is particularly crisply coloured in the breeding season, his bill bright red and bearing a prominent knob at the forehead. <br/><br/>Ducklings are white, with black cap, hindneck and wing and back patches. Juveniles are similarly coloured, greyish above and mostly white below, but already have the adult's wing pattern. <br/><br/>The call is a loud honk.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a distinctive waterfowl, 58 to 70 cm (23 to 28 in) in length with a wingspan of 110 to 135 cm (43 to 53 in). It has orange-brown body plumage with a paler head, while the tail and the flight feathers in the wings are black, contrasting with the white wing-coverts. It is a migratory bird, wintering in the Indian subcontinent and breeding in southeastern Europe and central Asia, though there are small resident populations in North Africa. It has a loud honking call.<br/><br/>The ruddy shelduck mostly inhabits inland water-bodies such as lakes, reservoirs and rivers. The male and female form a lasting pair bond and the nest may be well away from water, in a crevice or hole in a cliff, tree or similar site. A clutch of about eight eggs is laid and is incubated solely by the female for about four weeks. The young are cared for by both parents and fledge about eight weeks after hatching. <br/><br/>In central and eastern Asia, populations are steady or rising, but in Europe they are generally in decline. Altogether, the birds have a wide range and large total population, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed their conservation status as being of 'least concern'.<br/><br/>The ruddy shelduck grows to a length of 58 to 70 cm (23 to 28 in) and has a 110–135 cm (43–53 in) wingspan. The male has orange-brown body plumage and a paler, orange-brown head and neck, separated from the body by a narrow black collar. The rump, flight feathers, tail-coverts and tail feathers are black and there are iridescent green speculum feathers on the inner surfaces of the wings. Both upper and lower wing-coverts are white, this feature being particularly noticeable in flight but hardly visible when the bird is at rest. The bill is black and the legs are dark grey. The female is similar but has a rather pale, whitish head and neck and lacks the black collar, and in both sexes, the colouring is variable and fades as the feathers age. The birds moult at the end of the breeding season and the male loses the black collar, but a further partial moult between December and April restores it. Juveniles are similar to the female but are a darker shade of brown. <br/><br/>The call is a series of loud, nasal honking notes, it being possible to discern the difference between those produced by the male and the female. The calls are made both on the ground and in the air, and the sounds are variable according to the circumstances in which they are uttered. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The red-crested pochard (<i>Netta rufina</i>) is a large diving duck. The scientific name is derived from Greek Netta 'duck', and Latin rufina, 'golden-red' (from rufus, 'ruddy'). Its breeding habitat is lowland marshes and lakes in southern Europe and Central Asia, wintering in the Indian Subcontinent and Africa. It is somewhat migratory, and northern birds winter further south into north Africa.<br/><br/>The adult male is unmistakable. It has a rounded orange head, red bill and black breast. The flanks are white, the back brown, and the tail black. The female is mainly a pale brown, with a darker back and crown and a whitish face. Eclipse males are like females but with red bills. They are gregarious birds, forming large flocks in winter, often mixed with other diving ducks, such as common pochards. They feed mainly by diving or dabbling. They eat aquatic plants, and typically upend for food more than most diving ducks. <br/><br/>A wheezing veht call can be given by the male. Series of hoarse vrah-vrah-vrah calls can also be heard from females. <br/><br/>Red-crested pochards build nests by the lakeside among vegetation and lay 8–12 pale green eggs. The birds' status in the British Isles is much confused because there have been many escapes and deliberate releases over the years, as well as natural visitors from the continent. However, it is most likely that they are escapees that are now breeding wild and have built up a successful feral population. They are most numerous around areas of England including Gloucestershire, Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire. <br/><br/>The red-crested pochard is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It breeds in much of Europe and western Asia, but is strictly migratory, with the entire population moving to southern Africa, India (in particular Santragachi), and Australasia in winter, where large flocks can occur. This species was first described by Linnaeus in 1758. Like other small ducks such as the common teal, this species rises easily from the water with a fast twisting wader-like flight.<br/><br/>Their breeding habitat is grassland adjacent to shallow marshes and steppe lakes. <br/><br/>The adult male is unmistakable, with its brown head and breast with a broad white crescent over the eye. The rest of the plumage is grey, with loose grey scapular feathers It has a grey bill and legs. In flight it shows a pale blue speculum with a white border. When swimming it will show prominent white edges on its tertials. His crown (anatomy) is dark and face is reddish brown. <br/><br/>Some care is needed in separating the brown female from the similar common teal, but the stronger face markings and more frequent head-shaking when dabbling are good indicators. Confusion with the female of the blue-winged teal is also possible, but the head and bill shape is different, and the latter species has yellow legs. Pale eyebrow, dark eye line, pale lore spot bordered by a second dark line. <br/><br/>These birds feed mainly by skimming rather than upending. <br/><br/>The male has a distinctive crackling mating call; the female is rather silent for a female duck, but can manage a feeble quack. <br/><br/>Garganey are rare breeding birds in the British Isles, with most breeding in quiet marshes in Norfolk and Suffolk. In Ireland a few pairs now breed in Wexford, with occasional breeding elsewhere. <br/><br/>The garganey is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.

			"Commonname": "Mallard",
			"Genus": "Anas",
			"species": "platyrhynchos",
			"Description": "The mallard is a medium-sized waterfowl species that is often slightly heavier than most other dabbling ducks. It is 50–65 cm (20–26 in) long – of which the body makes up around two-thirds – has a wingspan of 81–98 cm (32–39 in), and weighs 0.72–1.58 kg (1.6–3.5 lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 25.7 to 30.6 cm (10.1 to 12.0 in), the bill is 4.4 to 6.1 cm (1.7 to 2.4 in), and the tarsus is 4.1 to 4.8 cm (1.6 to 1.9 in).<br/><br/>The breeding male mallard is unmistakable, with a glossy bottle-green head and a white collar that demarcates the head from the purple-tinged brown breast, grey-brown wings, and a pale grey belly. The rear of the male is black, with white-bordered dark tail feathers. The bill of the male is a yellowish-orange tipped with black, with that of the female generally darker and ranging from black to mottled orange and brown. The female mallard is predominantly mottled, with each individual feather showing sharp contrast from buff to very dark brown, a coloration shared by most female dabbling ducks, and has buff cheeks, eyebrow, throat, and neck, with a darker crown and eye-stripe. <br/><br/>Both male and female mallards have distinct iridescent purple-blue speculum feathers edged with white, which are prominent in flight or at rest but temporarily shed during the annual summer moult. Upon hatching, the plumage of the duckling is yellow on the underside and face (with streaks by the eyes) and black on the back (with some yellow spots) all the way to the top and back of the head. Its legs and bill are also black. As it nears a month in age, the duckling's plumage starts becoming drab, looking more like the female, though more streaked, and its legs lose their dark grey colouring. Two months after hatching, the fledgling period has ended, and the duckling is now a juvenile. Between three and four months of age, the juvenile can finally begin flying, as its wings are fully developed for flight (which can be confirmed by the sight of purple speculum feathers). Its bill soon loses its dark grey colouring, and its sex can finally be distinguished visually by three factors: 1) the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2) the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3) in males, the centre tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the centre tail feather is straight. During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (6–10 months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colours. This change in plumage also applies to adult mallard males when they transition in and out of their non-breeding eclipse plumage at the beginning and the end of the summer moulting period.  The adulthood age for mallards is fourteen months, and the average life expectancy is three years, but they can live to twenty. <br/><br/>Several species of duck have brown-plumaged females that can be confused with the female mallard. The female gadwall (<i>A. strepera</i>) has an orange-lined bill, white belly, black and white speculum that is seen as a white square on the wings in flight, and is a smaller bird. More similar to the female mallard in North America are the American black duck (<i>A. rubripes</i>), which is notably darker-hued in both sexes than the mallard, and the mottled duck (<i>A. fulvigula</i>), which is somewhat darker than the female mallard, and with slightly different bare-part colouration and no white edge on the speculum. <br/><br/>In captivity, domestic ducks come in wild-type plumages, white, and other colours. Most of these colour variants are also known in domestic mallards not bred as livestock, but kept as pets, aviary birds, etc., where they are rare but increasing in availability. <br/><br/>Owing to their highly 'malleable' genetic code, mallards can display a large amount of variation, as seen here with this female, who displays faded or 'apricot' plumage. <br/><br/>A noisy species, the female has the deep quack stereotypically associated with ducks. Male mallards make a sound phonetically similar to that of the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call that sounds like a truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise. <br/><br/>The mallard is a rare example of both Allen's Rule and Bergmann's Rule in birds. Bergmann's Rule, which states that polar forms tend to be larger than related ones from warmer climates, has numerous examples in birds, as in case of the Greenland mallard which is larger than the mallards further south. Allen's Rule says that appendages like ears tend to be smaller in polar forms to minimise heat loss, and larger in tropical and desert equivalents to facilitate heat diffusion, and that the polar taxa are stockier overall. Examples of this rule in birds are rare as they lack external ears, but the bill of ducks is supplied with a few blood vessels to prevent heat loss, and, as in the Greenland mallard, the bill is smaller than that of birds farther south, illustrating the rule. <br/><br/>Due to the variability of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and have resulted in a wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, <i>Anas strepera</i>)",

The male is 59–76 cm (23–30 in) in length and weighs 450–1,360 g (0.99–3.00 lb), and therefore is considerably larger than the female, which is 51–64 cm (20–25 in) long and weighs 454–1,135 g (1.001–2.502 lb). The northern pintail broadly overlaps in size with the similarly-widespread mallard, but is more slender, elongated and gracile, with a relatively longer neck and (in males) a longer tail. The unmistakable breeding plumaged male has a chocolate-brown head and white breast with a white stripe extending up the side of the neck. Its upperparts and sides are grey, but elongated grey feathers with black central stripes are draped across the back from the shoulder area. The vent area is yellow, contrasting with the black underside of the tail, which has the central feathers elongated to as much as 10 cm (3.9 in). The bill is bluish and the legs are blue-grey.<br/><br/>The adult female is mainly scalloped and mottled in light brown with a more uniformly grey-brown head, and its pointed tail is shorter than the male's; it is still easily identified by its shape, long neck, and long grey bill. In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake pintail looks similar to the female, but retains the male upperwing pattern and long grey shoulder feathers. Juvenile birds resemble the female, but are less neatly scalloped and have a duller brown speculum with a narrower trailing edge. <br/><br/>The pintail walks well on land, and swims well. It has a very fast flight, with its wings slightly swept-back, rather than straight out from the body like other ducks. In flight, the male shows a black speculum bordered white at the rear and pale rufous at the front, whereas the female's speculum is dark brown bordered with white, narrowly at the front edge but very prominently at the rear, being visible at a distance of 1,600 m (0.99 mi). <br/><br/>The male's call is a soft proop-proop whistle, similar to that of the common teal, whereas the female has a mallard-like descending quack, and a low croak when flushed. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The Eurasian teal is the smallest extant dabbling duck at 20–30 cm (7.9–11.8 in) length and with an average weight of 340 g (12 oz) in drake (males) and 320 g (11 oz) in hens (females). The wings are 17.5–20.4 cm (6.9–8.0 in) long, yielding a wingspan of 53–59 cm (21–23 in). The bill measures 3.2–4 cm (1.3–1.6 in) in length, and the tarsus 2.8–3.4 cm (1.1–1.3 in).<br/><br/>From a distance, the drakes in nuptial plumage appear grey, with a dark head, a yellowish behind, and a white stripe running along the flanks. Their head and upper neck is chestnut, with a wide and iridescent dark green patch of half-moon- or teardrop-shape that starts immediately before the eye and arcs to the upper hindneck. The patch is bordered with thin yellowish-white lines, and a single line of that colour extends from the patch's forward end, curving along the base of the bill. The breast is buff with small round brown spots. The center of the belly is white, and the rest of the body plumage is mostly white with thin and dense blackish vermiculations, appearing medium grey even at a short distance. The outer scapular feathers are white, with a black border to the outer vanes, and form the white side-stripe when the bird is in resting position. The primary remiges are dark greyish brown; the speculum feathers are iridescent blackish-green with white tips, and form the speculum together with the yellowish-white tips of the larger upperwing coverts (which are otherwise grey). The underwing is whitish, with grey remiges, dense dark spotting on the inner coverts and a dark leading edge. The tail and tail coverts are black, with a bright yellowish-buff triangular patch in the center of the coverts at each side. <br/><br/>Drake in eclipse plumage (rightmost bird), hen and young<br/><br/>In non-breeding (eclipse) plumage, the drake looks more like the hen; it is more uniform in colour, with a dark head and vestigial facial markings. The hen itself is yellowish-brown, somewhat darker on wings and back. It has a dark greyish-brown upper head, hindneck, eyestripe and feather pattern. The pattern is dense short streaks on the head and neck, and scaly spots on the rest of the body; overall they look much like a tiny mallard (<i>A. platyrhynchos</i>) hen when at rest. The wings are coloured similar to the drake's, but with brown instead of grey upperwing coverts that have less wide tips, and wider tips of the speculum feathers. The hen's rectrices have yellowish-white tips; the midbelly is whitish with some dark streaking. <br/><br/>Immatures are coloured much like hens, but have a stronger pattern. The downy young are coloured like in other dabbling ducks: brown above and yellow below, with a yellow supercilium. They are recognizable by their tiny size however, weighing just 15 g (0.53 oz) at hatching. <br/><br/>The drake's bill is dark grey, in eclipse plumage often with some light greenish or brownish hue at the base. The bill of hens and immatures is pinkish or yellowish at the base, becoming dark grey towards the tip; the grey expands basewards as the birds age. The feet are dark grey in males and greyish olive or greyish-brown in females and immatures. The iris is always brown. <br/><br/>Moults during summer. Male in eclipse resembles female, but with darker upperparts and grey bill. Flight feathers are moulted simultaneously and birds are flightless for up to 4 weeks. <br/><br/>This is a noisy species. The male whistles cryc or creelycc, not loud but very clear and far-carrying. The female has a feeble keh or neeh quack. <br/><br/>Males in nuptial plumage are distinguished from green-winged teals by the horizontal white scapular stripe, the lack of a vertical white bar at the breast sides, and the quite conspicuous light outlines of the face patch, which are indistinct in the green-winged teal drake. Males in eclipse plumage, females and immatures are best recognised by their small size, calls, and the speculum; they are hard to tell apart from the green-winged teal however. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It should not be confused with the Japanese quail, <i>Coturnix japonica</i>, native to Asia, which, although visually similar, has a very distinct call. Like the Japanese quail, common quails are sometimes kept as poultry.<br/><br/>It is a small, round bird, essentially streaked brown with a white eyestripe, and, in the male, a white chin. As befits its migratory nature, it has long wings, unlike the typically short-winged gamebirds. It measures roughly 18.0–21.9 cm (7.1–8.62 in) and weighs 91–131 g (3.2–4.62 oz)<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The black colour continues down onto the lower throat as a patch of broad triangular black streaks on a pale sandy-grey background. Similar, but narrower, black streaks are present on a pale blue-grey background on the upper neck-sides, while the lower neck-sides are warm pinkish-brown. The breast is pale blue-grey, and the belly pinkish-buff. The flanks are marked with bold bright rufous-brown bars, typically between eight and ten; each bar has a narrow black leading edge, the background colour is off-white in front of each bar, and pale grey behind. The upper parts are plain, unmarked dark sandy-grey. The uppertail-coverts are similar in colour, and contrast with the pinkish-rufous tail-feathers. <br/><br/>The bill is bright red, the iris is medium brown, and the legs are pinkish-red. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Phasianus",
			"species": "colchicus",
			"Description": "There are many colour forms of the male common pheasant, ranging in colour from nearly white to almost black in some melanistic examples. These are due to captive breeding and hybridization between subspecies and with the green pheasant, reinforced by continual releases of stock from varying sources to the wild. For example, the 'ring-necked pheasants' common in Europe, North America and Australia do not pertain to any specific taxon, they rather represent a stereotyped hybrid swarm. Body weight can range from 0.5 to 3 kg (1.1 to 6.6 lb), with males averaging 1.2 kg (2.6 lb) and females averaging 0.9 kg (2.0 lb).<br/><br/>The adult male common pheasant of the nominate subspecies <i>Phasianus colchicus colchicus</i> is 60–89 cm (24–35 in) in length with a long brown streaked black tail, accounting for almost 50 cm (20 in) of the total length. The body plumage is barred bright gold or fiery copper-red and chestnut-brown plumage with iridescent sheen of green and purple; but rump uniform is sometimes blue. The wing coverage is white or cream and black-barred markings are common on the tail. The head is bottle green with a small crest and distinctive red wattle. <i>P. c. colchicus</i> and some other races lack a white neck ring. Behind the face are two ear-tufts, that make the pheasant to alert. <br/><br/>The female (hen) and juveniles are much less showy, with a duller mottled brown plumage all over and measuring 50–63 cm (20–25 in) long including a tail of around 20 cm (7.9 in). Juvenile birds have the appearance of the female with a shorter tail until young males begin to grow characteristic bright feathers on the breast, head and back at about 10 weeks after hatching. <br/><br/>The green pheasant (<i>P. versicolor</i>) is very similar, and hybridization often makes the identity of individual birds difficult to determine. Green pheasant males on average have a shorter tail than the common pheasant and have darker plumage that is uniformly bottle-green on the breast and belly; they always lack a neck ring. Green pheasant females are darker, with many black dots on the breast and belly. <br/><br/>In addition, various colour mutations are commonly encountered, mainly melanistic (black) and flavistic (isabelline or fawn) specimens. The former are rather common in some areas and are named Tenebrosus pheasant (<i>P. colchicus var. tenebrosus</i>).<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The greater flamingo (<i>Phoenicopterus roseus</i>) is the most widespread species of the flamingo family. It is found in Africa, on the Indian subcontinent, in the Middle East and southern Europe.<br/><br/>This is the largest species of flamingo, averaging 110–150 cm (43–59 in) tall and weighing 2–4 kg (4.4–8.8 lb). The largest male flamingos have been recorded at up to 187 cm (74 in) tall and 4.5 kg (9.9 lb). It is closely related to the American flamingo and Chilean flamingo, with which it has sometimes been considered conspecific. <br/><br/>Like all flamingos, this species lays a single chalky-white egg on a mud mound. Most of the plumage is pinkish white, but the wing coverts are red and the primary and secondary flight feathers are black. The bill is pink with a restricted black tip, and the legs are entirely pink. The call is a goose-like honking. <br/><br/>Sub-adult flamingos are whitish grey and only attain the pink coloration several years into their adult life. The coloration comes from the carotenoid pigments in the organisms that live in their feeding grounds. Secretions of the uropygial gland also contain carotenoids. During the breeding season, greater flamingos increase the frequency of their spreading uropygial secretions over their feathers and thereby enhance their colour. This cosmetic use of uropygial secretions has been described as applying 'make-up'.<br/><br/>The bird resides in mudflats and shallow coastal lagoons with salt water. Using its feet, the bird stirs up the mud, then sucks water through its bill and filters out small shrimp, seeds, blue-green algae, microscopic organisms and molluscs. The greater flamingo feeds with its head down and its upper jaw is movable and not rigidly fixed to its skull. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The adults are unmistakable in summer with head and neck decorations. In winter, this is whiter than most grebes, with white above the eye, and a pink bill. <br/><br/>The young are distinctive because their heads are striped black and white.

			"Description": "The black-necked grebe usually measures between 28 and 34 centimetres (11 and 13 in) in length and weighs 265 to 450 grams (9.3 to 15.9 oz). The nominate subspecies in breeding plumage has the head, neck, breast, and upperparts coloured black to blackish brown, with the exception of the ochre-coloured fan of feathers extending behind the eye over the eye-coverts and sides of the nape. This eye is mostly red, with a narrow and paler yellow ring on the inner parts of the eye and an orange-yellow to pinkish-red orbital ring. The thin, upturned bill, on the other hand, is black, and is connected to the eye by a blackish line starting at the gape. Sometimes, the foreneck can be found to be mostly tinged brown. The upperwing is blackish to drab brown in colour and has a white patch formed by the secondaries and part of the inner primaries. The flanks are coloured tawny rufous to maroon-chestnut and have the occasional blackish fleck. The underwing and abdomen is white, with an exception to the former being the dark tertials and the mostly pale grey-brown outer primaries. The legs are a dark greenish grey. The sexes are similar.<br/><br/>In non-breeding plumage, the nominate has greyish-black upperparts, cap, nape, and hindneck, with the colour on the upper portion of the latter being contained in a vertical stripe. The dark colour of the cap reaches below the eye and can be seen, diffused, to the ear-coverts. Behind the ear-coverts on the sides of the neck, there are white ovals. The rest of the neck is grey to brownish-grey in colour and has white that varies in amount. The breast is white, and the abdomen is whitish. The flanks are coloured in a mix of blackish-grey with white flecks. The colour of the bill when not breeding differs from that of the breeding plumage, with the former being significantly more grey. <br/><br/>The juvenile black-necked grebe is similar to the non-breeding adult. There are differences, however, including the fact that the dark areas are usually more brownish in the juvenile, with less black. The lores are often tinged pale grey, with whitish marks behind the eye. On the sides of the head and upper neck, there is a buffy or tawny tinge. The chick is downy and has a blackish-grey head with stripes and spots that are white or pale buff-grey. The throat and foreneck are largely pale. The upperparts are mostly dark grey in colour, and the abdomen is white. <br/><br/>The subspecies <i>californicus</i> usually has a longer bill compared to the nominate, and has brown-grey inner primaries during the breeding season. When not breeding, the nominate has diffuse and pale lores less often than <i>Podiceps nigricollis californicus</i>. The other subspecies, <i>P. n. gurneyi</i>, is the smallest of the three subspecies, in addition to having a greyer head and upperparts. The adult of this subspecies also has a rufous-brown tinge on its lesser wing-coverts. It also lacks a non-breeding plumage, in addition to the tufts on the side of its head being paler. <br/><br/>When breeding, the black-necked grebe gives a quiet 'ooeek' that ascends in pitch from an already high pitch. This call is also used as a territorial call, in addition to a low and fast trill, which itself is also used during courtship. Another call is a short 'puuii' or 'wit'. This grebe is silent when it is not the breeding season and when it is feeding or resting. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The adult of the nominate subspecies of the rock dove is 29 to 37 cm (11 to 15 in) long with a 62 to 72 cm (24 to 28 in) wingspan. Weight for wild or feral rock doves ranges from 238–380 g (8.4–13.4 oz), though overfed domestic and semi-domestic individuals can exceed normal weights. It has a dark bluish-grey head, neck, and chest with glossy yellowish, greenish, and reddish-purple iridescence along its neck and wing feathers. The iris is orange, red or golden with a paler inner ring, and the bare skin round the eye is bluish-grey. The bill is grey-black with a conspicuous off-white cere, and the feet are purplish-red. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is typically around 22.3 cm (8.8 in), the tail is 9.5 to 11 cm (3.7 to 4.3 in), the bill is around 1.8 cm (0.71 in) and the tarsus is 2.6 to 3.5 cm (1.0 to 1.4 in).<br/><br/>The adult female is almost identical to the male, but the iridescence on the neck is less intense and more restricted to the rear and sides, while that on the breast is often very obscure. <br/><br/>The white lower back of the pure rock dove is its best identification character; the two black bars on its pale grey wings are also distinctive. The tail has a black band on the end and the outer web of the tail feathers are margined with white. It is strong and quick on the wing, dashing out from sea caves, flying low over the water, its lighter grey rump showing well from above. <br/><br/>Young birds show little lustre and are duller. Eye colour of the pigeon is generally orange but a few pigeons may have white-grey eyes. The eyelids are orange in colour and are encapsulated in a grey-white eye ring. The feet are red to pink. <br/><br/>When circling overhead, the white underwing of the bird becomes conspicuous. In its flight, behaviour, and voice, which is more of a dovecot coo than the phrase of the wood pigeon, it is a typical pigeon. Although it is a relatively strong flier, it also glides frequently, holding its wings in a very pronounced V shape as it does. Though fields are visited for grain and green food, it is often not plentiful enough as to be a viewed as pest. <br/><br/>Pigeons feed on the ground in flocks or individually. They roost together in buildings or on walls or statues. When drinking, most birds take small sips and tilt their heads backwards to swallow the water. Pigeons are able to dip their bills into the water and drink continuously without having to tilt their heads back. When disturbed, a pigeon in a group will take off with a noisy clapping sound. <br/><br/>Pigeons, especially homing or carrier breeds, are well known for their ability to find their way home from long distances. Despite these demonstrated abilities, wild rock doves are sedentary and rarely leave their local areas<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It belongs to the Columba genus and, like all pigeons and doves, belongs to the family Columbidae. <br/><br/>The three Western European Columba pigeons, common wood pigeon, stock dove, and rock pigeon, though superficially alike, have very distinctive characteristics; the common wood pigeon may be identified at once by its larger size at 38–44.5 cm (15.0–17.5 in) and 300–615 g (10.6–21.7 oz), and the white on its neck and wing. It is otherwise a basically grey bird, with a pinkish breast. The wingspan can range from 68 to 80 cm (27 to 31 in) and the wing chord measures 24 to 25.4 cm (9.4 to 10.0 in). The tail measures 13.8 to 15 cm (5.4 to 5.9 in), the bill is 1.9 to 2.2 cm (0.75 to 0.87 in) and the tarsus is 2.5 to 2.8 cm (0.98 to 1.10 in). Adult birds bear a series of green and white patches on their necks, and a pink patch on their chest.<br/><br/>Juvenile birds do not have the white patches on either side of the neck. When they are about six months old (about three months out of the nest) they gain small white patches on both sides of the neck, which gradually enlarge until they are fully formed when the bird is about 6–8 months old (approx. ages only). Juvenile birds also have a greyer beak and an overall lighter grey appearance than adult birds. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "Smaller and slighter in build than many other doves, it measures 24–29 cm (9.4–11.4 in) in length, 47–55 cm (19–22 in) in wingspan and weighs 85–170 g (3.0–6.0 oz). The European turtle dove may be recognised by its browner colour, and the black-and-white-striped patch on the side of its neck. The tail is notable as the bird flies from the observer; it is wedge shaped, with a dark centre and white borders and tips. When viewed from below, this pattern, owing to the white under-tail coverts obscuring the dark bases, is a blackish chevron on a white ground. This can be seen when the bird stoops to drink and raises its spread tail.<br/><br/>The mature bird has the head, neck, flanks, and rump blue grey, and the wings cinnamon, mottled with black. The breast is vinaceous, the abdomen and under tail coverts are white. The bill is black, the legs and eye rims are red. The black and white patch on the side of the neck is absent in the browner and duller juvenile bird, which also has the legs brown. <br/><br/>The turtle dove, one of the latest migrants, rarely appears in Northern Europe before the end of April, returning south again in September. <br/><br/>It is a bird of open rather than dense woodlands, and frequently feeds on the ground. It will occasionally nest in large gardens, but is usually extremely timid, probably due to the heavy hunting pressure it faces during migration. The flight is often described as arrowy, but is not remarkably swift. <br/><br/>The nuptial flight, high and circling, is like that of the common wood pigeon, but the undulations are less decided; it is accompanied by the whip-crack of the downward flicked wings. The arrival in spring is heralded by its purring song, a rather deep, vibrating ‘turrr, turrr’. Despite the identical spelling, the 'turtle' of the name, derived from Latin turtur, has no connection with the reptile; ‘turtle’ in this case came originally from Latin tortur, onomatopoeic for the song. The genus name <i>Streptopelia </i>is from Ancient Greek streptos, ‘collar’ and peleia, ‘dove’.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "It is a medium-sized dove, distinctly smaller than the wood pigeon, similar in length to a rock pigeon but slimmer and longer-tailed, and slightly larger than the related turtle dove, with an average length of 32 cm (13 in) from tip of beak to tip of tail, with a wingspan of 47–55 cm (19–22 in), and a weight of 125–240 g (4.4–8.5 oz). It is grey-buff to pinkish-grey overall, a little darker above than below, with a blue-grey under wing patch. The tail feathers are grey-buff above, and dark grey tipped white below; the outer tail feathers also tipped whitish above. It has a black half-collar edged with white on its nape from which it gets its name. The short legs are red and the bill is black. The iris is red, but from a distance the eyes appear to be black, as the pupil is relatively large and only a narrow rim of reddish-brown iris can be seen around the black pupil. The eye is surrounded by a small area of bare skin, which is either white or yellow. The two sexes are virtually indistinguishable; juveniles differ in having a poorly developed collar, and a brown iris.<br/><br/>There are two subspecies, <i>Streptopelia decaocto decaocto</i> in most of the range (including all of the 20th century colonisations), and <i>Streptopelia decaocto xanthocyclus </i>in the southeast of the range from Burma east to southern China. The latter differs in having yellow skin around the eye (white in the nominate subspecies). Two other subspecies formerly sometimes accepted, <i>Streptopelia decaocto stoliczkae </i>from Turkestan in central Asia, and <i>Streptopelia decaocto intercedens </i>from southern India and Sri Lanka, are now considered synonyms of <i>S. d. decaocto. </i> <br/><br/>It is closely related to the island collared dove of southeast Asia and the African collared dove of sub-Saharan Africa, forming a superspecies with these. Identification from African collared dove is very difficult with silent birds, with the African species being marginally smaller and paler, but the calls are very distinct, a soft purring in African collared dove quite unlike the Eurasian collared dove's cooing. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Although it lives in arid lands, it is found around water sources.<br/><br/>This bird is typically around 26 cm in length. Its upper body, from shoulders to tail, is a pale grayish brown, though the wing edge has a bluish tinge. Flight feathers are darker, and nearly black. Head, neck and breast are pinkish shading to white on the chin and belly. There is little sexual dimorphism. <br/><br/>The African collared dove is the species thought to be the wild ancestor of the domestic Barbary dove, though some suggest the Eurasian collared dove (<i>Streptopelia decaocto</i>) may also have been involved. The African collared dove is able to hybridise with the Barbary dove, and it is thought that the increase in the range of colours of Barbary doves available that occurred in the later twentieth century was the result of the importation of African collared doves into the United States for interbreeding. <br/><br/>It is reported to have been introduced into New Zealand, but it is more likely that the birds there are descended from domestic Barbary doves. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

During the day this nightjar lies silent upon the ground, concealed by its plumage; it is difficult to detect, looking like a bit of lichen-covered twig or a fragment of bark. The length is 32 cm, and the wingspan 64 cm. Like other nightjars, it has a wide gape, long wings, soft downy plumage and nocturnal habits. <br/><br/>Its call is a repetitive mechanical kyok-kyok-kyok..., which rises and falls as the bird turns its head from side to side. When it churrs, the bird lies or crouches along a branch or rail, but it will sing from a post. During courtship, and occasionally at other times, it uses a mechanical signal, a sharp cracking sound, caused by clapping the wings together over the back. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Caprimulgus",
			"species": "europaeus",
			"Description": "The European nightjar is 24.5–28 cm (9.6–11.0 in) long, with a 52–59 cm (20–23 in) wingspan. The male weighs 51–101 g (1.8–3.6 oz) and the female 67–95 g (2.4–3.4 oz). The adult of the nominate subspecies has greyish-brown upperparts with dark streaking, a pale buff hindneck collar and a white moustachial line. The closed wing is grey with buff spotting, and the underparts are greyish-brown, with brown barring and buff spots. The bill is blackish, the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are brown.<br/><br/>The flight on long pointed wings is noiseless, due to their soft plumage, and very buoyant.  Flying birds can be sexed since the male has a white wing patch across three primary feathers and white tips to the two outer tail feathers, whereas females do not show any white in flight. Chicks have downy brown and buff plumage, and the fledged young are similar in appearance to the adult female. Adults moult their body feathers from June onwards after breeding, suspend the process while migrating, and replace the tail and flight feathers on the wintering grounds. Moult is completed between January and March. Immature birds follow a similar moult strategy to the adults unless they are from late broods, in which case the entire moult may take place in Africa. <br/><br/>Other nightjar species occur in parts of the breeding and wintering ranges. The red-necked nightjar breeds in Iberia and northwest Africa; it is larger, greyer and longer winged than the European nightjar, and has a broad buff collar and more conspicuous white markings on the wings and tail. Wintering European nightjars in Africa may overlap with the related rufous-cheeked and sombre nightjars. Both have a more prominent buff hind-neck collar and more spotting on the wing coverts. The sombre nightjar is also much darker than its European cousin. Given their nocturnal habits, cryptic plumage and difficulty of observation, nightjar observation \"is as much a matter of fortune as effort or knowledge\".<br/><br/> The male European nightjar's song is a sustained churring trill, given continuously for up to 10 minutes with occasional shifts of speed or pitch. It is delivered from a perch, and the male may move around its territory using different song posts. Singing is more frequent at dawn and dusk than during the night, and is reduced in poor weather. The song may end with a bubbling trill and wing-clapping, perhaps indicating the approach of a female. Migrating or wintering birds sometimes sing. Individual male nightjars can be identified by analysing the rate and length of the pulses in their songs. Even a singing male may be hard to locate; the perched bird is difficult to spot in low light conditions, and the song has a ventriloquial quality as the singer turns his head. The song is easily audible at 200 m (660 ft), and can be heard at 600 m (2,000 ft) in good conditions; it can be confused with the very similar sound of the European mole cricket. <br/><br/>The female does not sing, but when on the wing, both sexes give a short cuick, cuick call, also used when chasing predators. Other calls include variations on a sharp chuck when alarmed, hisses given by adults when handled or chicks when disturbed, and an assortment of wuk, wuk, wuk, muffled oak, oak and murmurs given at the nest. Large young have a threat display with the mouth opened wide while hissing loudly. <br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The genus name is from the Ancient Greek takhus, &lsquo;fast&rsquo;, and marptis, &lsquo;seizer&rsquo;. The specific melba has no known explanation.<br/><br/>Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa.<br/><br/>Swifts have very short legs which are used for clinging to vertical surfaces. They never settle voluntarily on the ground, spending most of their lives in the air living on the insects they catch in their beaks. Alpine swift are able to stay aloft in the air for up to seven months at a time, even drinking water &lsquo;on the wing&rsquo;.<br/><br/>The bird is superficially similar to a large barn swallow or house martin. It is, however, completely unrelated to those passerine species, since swifts are in the order Apodiformes. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution, reflecting similar life styles.<br/><br/>Swifts have very short legs which they use only for clinging to vertical surfaces. The scientific name Apodidae comes from the Ancient Greek &alpha;&pi;&omicron;&upsilon;&sigmaf;, apous, meaning &lsquo;without feet&rsquo;. They never settle voluntarily on the ground.<br/><br/>Alpine swifts breed in mountains from southern Europe to the Himalaya. Like common swifts, they are strongly migratory, and winter much further south in southern Africa. They wander widely on migration, and are regularly seen in much of southern Europe and Asia. The species seems to have been much more widespread during the last ice age, with a large colony breeding, for example in the Late Pleistocene Cave No 16, Bulgaria, around 18,000&ndash;40,000 years ago. The same situation has been found for Komarowa Cave near Cz?stochowa, Poland during a period about 20,000&ndash;40,000 years ago.<br/><br/>These apodiformes build their nests in colonies in a suitable cliff hole or cave, laying two or three eggs. Swifts will return to the same sites year after year, rebuilding their nests when necessary, and pairing for life. Young swifts in the nest can drop their body temperature and become torpid if bad weather prevents their parents from catching insects nearby. They have adapted well to urban conditions, frequently nesting in old buildings in towns around the Mediterranean, where large, low-flying flocks are a familiar feature in summer.<br/><br/>Alpine swifts are readily distinguished from the common swifts by their larger size and their white belly and throat. They are around twice as big as most other swifts in its range, about 20 to 23 cm (7.9 to 9.1 in) in length, with a wingspan of 57 cm (22 in) and a weight of around 100 g (3.5 oz). They're largely dark brown in colour, with white patches underneath the beak and on the breast that are separated by a dark brown streak. Juveniles are similar to adults, but their feathers are pale edged.<br/><br/>In comparison, the common swift has a wingspan of around 42 cm (17 in). A dark neck band separates the white throat from the white belly. They have a short forked tail and very long swept-back wings that resemble a crescent or a boomerang but may (as in the image) be held stretched straight out. Their flight is slower and more powerful than that of their smaller relative, with a call that is a drawn-out twittering (listen at right).",

It is a brood parasite, which means it lays eggs in the nests of other bird species, particularly of dunnocks, meadow pipits, and reed warblers. Although its eggs are larger than those of its hosts, the eggs in each type of host nest resemble the host's eggs. The adult too is a mimic, in its case of the sparrowhawk; since that species is a predator, the mimicry gives the female time to lay her eggs without being seen to do so.<br/><br/>The common cuckoo is 32&ndash;34 centimetres (13&ndash;13 in) long from bill to tail (with a tail of 13&ndash;15 centimetres (5.1&ndash;5.9 in) and a wingspan of 55&ndash;60 centimetres (22&ndash;24 in). The legs are short. It is greyish with a slender body and long tail and can be mistaken for a falcon in flight, where the wingbeats are regular. During the breeding season, common cuckoos often settle on an open perch with drooped wings and raised tail. There is a rufous colour morph, which occurs occasionally in adult females but more often in juveniles.<br/><br/>All adult males are slate-grey; the grey throat extends well down the bird's breast with a sharp demarcation to the barred underparts. The iris, orbital ring, the base of the bill and feet are yellow. Grey adult females have a pinkish-buff or buff background to the barring and neck sides, and sometimes small rufous spots on the median and greater coverts and the outer webs of the secondary feathers.<br/><br/>Rufous morph adult females have reddish-brown upperparts with dark grey or black bars. The black upperpart bars are narrower than the rufous bars, as opposed to rufous juvenile birds, where the black bars are broader.<br/><br/>Common cuckoos in their first autumn have variable plumage. Some are have strongly-barred chestnut-brown upperparts, while others are plain grey. Rufous-brown birds have heavily barred upperparts with some feathers edged with creamy-white. All have whitish edges to the upper wing-coverts and primaries. The secondaries and greater coverts have chestnut bars or spots. In spring, birds hatched in the previous year may retain some barred secondaries and wing-coverts. The most obvious identification features of juvenile common cuckoos are the white nape patch and white feather fringes.<br/><br/>Common cuckoos moult twice a year: a partial moult in summer and a complete moult in winter. Males weigh around 130 grams (4.6 oz) and females 110 grams (3.9 oz). The common cuckoo looks very similar to the Oriental cuckoo, which is slightly shorter-winged on average.",

Immature birds are generally similar in appearance to the adults, but the blue-grey in the plumage is replaced by buff. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails. The former subspecies <em>R. indicus</em>, has distinctive markings and a call that is very different from the pig-like squeal of the western races, and is now usually split as a separate species, the brown-cheeked rail.<br/><br/>The water rail breeds in reed beds and other marshy sites with tall, dense vegetation, building its nest a little above the water level from whatever plants are available nearby. The off-white, blotched eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and the precocial downy chicks hatch in 19&ndash;22 days. The female will defend her eggs and brood against intruders, or move them to another location if they are discovered. This species can breed after its first year, and it normally raises two clutches in each season. Water rails are omnivorous, feeding mainly on invertebrates during summer and berries or plant stems towards winter. They are territorial even after breeding, and will aggressively defend feeding areas in winter.<br/><br/>These rails are vulnerable to flooding or freezing conditions, loss of habitat and predation by mammals and large birds. The introduced American mink has exterminated some island populations, but overall the species' huge range and large numbers mean that it is not considered to be threatened.<br/><br/>The adult of the nominate subspecies is a medium-sized rail, 23&ndash;28 cm (9.1&ndash;11.0 in) long with a 38&ndash;45 cm (15&ndash;18 in) wingspan. Males typically weigh 114&ndash;164 g (4.0&ndash;5.8 oz) and females are slightly lighter at 92&ndash;107 g (3.2&ndash;3.8 oz). The upper parts from the forehead to tail are olive-brown with black streaks, especially on the shoulders. The sides of the head and the underparts down to the upper belly are dark slate-blue, except for a blackish area between bill and eye, and brownish sides to the upper breast. The flanks are barred black and white, and the undertail is white with some darker streaks. The long bill and the iris are red, and the legs are flesh-brown. The sexes are similar; although the female averages slightly smaller than the male, with a more slender bill, determining sex through measurements alone is unreliable. The juvenile has a blackish crown and a white chin and throat. The underparts are buff or white with darker bars, and the flank markings are brown and buff, rather than black and white. The undertail is buff, and the eye, bill and leg colours are duller than the adult. The downy chick is all black apart from a mainly white bill. After breeding, the rail has an extensive moult, and is flightless for about three weeks. Individual adults can be identified by the markings on the undertail, which are unique to each bird. Adult males have the strongest black undertail streaks. It has been suggested that the dark barring on the undertail of this species is a compromise between the signalling function of a pure white undertail, as found in open water or gregarious species like the common moorhen, and the need to avoid being too conspicuous.<br/><br/>The water rail can readily be distinguished from most other reed bed rails by its white undertail and red bill; the latter is a little longer than the rest of the rail's head (55&ndash;58% of the total) and slightly down-curved. The somewhat similar slaty-breasted rail of tropical Asia has a stouter bill, a chestnut crown and white-spotted upperparts. Juvenile and freshly moulted water rails may show a buff undertail like spotted crake, but that species' plumage is spotted with white, and it has a much shorter, mainly yellowish bill. The range of the water rail does not overlap with that of any other Rallus species, but vagrants could be distinguished from their American relatives by the lack of rufous or chestnut on the closed wing. The larger African rail has unstreaked darker brown upperparts and brighter red legs and feet.",

			"Description": "The spotted crake (<em>Porzana porzana</em>) is a small waterbird of the family Rallidae. The scientific name is derived from Venetian terms for small rails.<br/><br/>The spotted crake's breeding habitat is marshes and sedge beds across temperate Europe into western Asia. They nest in a dry location in marsh vegetation, laying 6&ndash;15 eggs. This species is migratory, wintering in Africa and Pakistan.<br/><br/>At 19&ndash;22.5 cm (7.5&ndash;8.9 in) length, spotted crakes are slightly smaller than water rails, from which they are readily distinguished by the short straight bill, yellow with a red base. Adults have mainly brown upperparts and blue-grey breast, with dark barring and white spots on the flanks. They have green legs with long toes, and a short tail which is buff underneath.<br/><br/>Immature spotted crakes are similar, but the blue-grey is replaced by brown. The downy chicks are black, as with all rails.<br/><br/>The only confusion species is the sora, a rare vagrant from North America. However, that species lacks the breast spotting and has an unstreaked crown stripe.<br/><br/>These birds probe with their bill in mud or shallow water, also picking up food by sight. They mainly eat insects and aquatic animals.<br/><br/>Spotted crakes are very secretive in the breeding season, and are then mostly heard rather than seen. They are then noisy birds, with a distinctive repetitive whiplash-like hwuit, hwuit call. They can be easier to see on migration.<br/><br/>The spotted crake is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. The Western European population has declined in recent decades, and the species is now a very rare breeding bird in Great Britain.",

It is distributed across many parts of the Old World.<br/><br/>The common moorhen lives around well-vegetated marshes, ponds, canals and other wetlands. The species is not found in the polar regions or many tropical rainforests. Elsewhere it is likely the most common rail species, except for the Eurasian coot in some regions.<br/><br/>The closely related common gallinule of the New World has been recognized as a separate species by most authorities, starting with the American Ornithologists' Union and the International Ornithological Committee in 2011.<br/><br/>The moorhen is a distinctive species, with dark plumage apart from the white undertail, yellow legs and a red frontal shield. The young are browner and lack the red shield. The frontal shield of the adult has a rounded top and fairly parallel sides; the tailward margin of the red unfeathered area is a smooth waving line. In the related common gallinule of the Americas, the frontal shield has a fairly straight top and is less wide towards the bill, giving a marked indentation to the back margin of the red area.<br/><br/>The common moorhen gives a wide range of gargling calls and will emit loud hisses when threatened. A midsized to large rail, it can range from 30 to 38&nbsp;cm (12 to 15&nbsp;in) in length and span 50 to 62&nbsp;cm (20 to 24&nbsp;in) across the wings.

Along with the sandhill (<em>Grus canadensis</em>) and demoiselle cranes and the brolga (<em>Grus rubicunda</em>), it is one of only four crane species not currently classified as threatened with extinction or conservation dependent on the species level.<br/><br/>The common crane is a large, stately bird and a medium-sized crane. It is 100&ndash;130&nbsp;cm (39&ndash;51&nbsp;in) long with a 180&ndash;240&nbsp;cm (71&ndash;94&nbsp;in) wingspan. The body weight can range from 3 to 6.1&nbsp;kg (6.6 to 13.4&nbsp;lb), with the nominate subspecies averaging around 5.4&nbsp;kg (12&nbsp;lb) and the eastern subspecies (<em>G. g. lilfordi</em>) averaging 4.6&nbsp;kg (10&nbsp;lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 50.7&ndash;60.8&nbsp;cm (20.0&ndash;23.9&nbsp;in) long, the tarsus is 20.1&ndash;25.2&nbsp;cm (7.9&ndash;9.9&nbsp;in) and the exposed culmen is 9.5&ndash;11.6&nbsp;cm (3.7&ndash;4.6&nbsp;in).<br/><br/>This species is slate-grey overall. The forehead and lores are blackish with a bare red crown and a white streak extending from behind the eyes to the upper back. The overall colour is darkest on the back and rump and palest on the breast and wings. The primaries, the tips of secondaries, the alula, the tip of the tail, and the edges of upper tail coverts are all black and the greater coverts droop into explosive plumes. This combination of colouration ultimately distinguishes it from similar species in Asia, like the hooded (<em>G. monacha</em>) and black-necked cranes (<em>G. nigricollis</em>). The juvenile has yellowish-brown tips to its body feathers and lacks the drooping wing feathers and the bright neck pattern of the adult, and has a fully feathered crown. Every two years, before migration, the adult common crane undergoes a complete moult, remaining flightless for six weeks, until the new feathers grow.<br/><br/>It has a loud trumpeting call, given in flight and display. The call is piercing and can be heard from a considerable distance. It has a dancing display, leaping with wings uplifted, described in detail below.",

			"Description": "The <strong>common loon</strong> or <strong>great northern diver</strong> (<em>Gavia immer</em>) is a large member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that includes a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure white&nbsp;underparts&nbsp;except some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), as well as in southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.<br/><br/>Common loons eat a wide range of animal prey including fish,&nbsp;crustaceans, insect larvae,&nbsp;molluscs, and occasionally aquatic plant life. They swallow most of their prey underwater, where it is caught, but some larger items are first brought to the surface. They are a seasonally&nbsp;monogamous&nbsp;breeders. Both members of a pair build a large nest out of dead&nbsp;marsh grasses&nbsp;and other plants formed into a mound along the vegetated shores of lakes. A single&nbsp;brood&nbsp;is raised each year from a clutch of one or two olive-brown oval&nbsp;eggs&nbsp;with dark brown spots which are incubated for 24 to 25 days by both parents. Fed by both parents, the chicks fledge in 70 to 77 days. The chicks are capable of diving underwater and they fly to their wintering areas before ice forms in the fall.<br/><br/>The adult common loon can range from 69 to 91&nbsp;cm (27 to 36&nbsp;in) in length with a 127 to 147&nbsp;cm (50 to 58&nbsp;in) wingspan, slightly smaller than the similar yellow-billed loon. Its weight can vary from 3.2 to 4.1&nbsp;kg (7.1 to 9.0&nbsp;lb). On average, it is about 81&nbsp;cm (32&nbsp;in) long, has a wingspan of 136&nbsp;cm (54&nbsp;in), and weighs about 4.1&nbsp;kg (9.0&nbsp;lb). Adult breeding plumage consists of a broad black head and neck with greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen. It has a black bill sometimes with a pale tip, and red eyes with red irises. The neck is encircled with a characteristic black ring and has two white necklaces of eight to ten short streaks on the upper foreneck, and a noticeable collar of white, parallel lines forming a large oval on the neck-side. The central lower foreneck is pure white, and the lower neck-sides has longitudinal white lines becoming rows of small spots and black lines becoming very narrow. The upperparts are blackish or blackish grey, and each feather has small white spots on it. The upperwing is blackish and with small white spots on the non-primary coverts, whereas the underwing is paler with white coverts except the long black shaft-streaks on the axillaries. The underparts are pure white, but have some black on the undertail coverts and vent. It has a checkered black-and-white mantle and a blackish tail. The legs are pale grey on the inner half and blackish on the outer half, and the webs between the toes are flesh coloured.<br/><br/>Adult non-breeding plumage is brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. The eyes are surrounded with white, and the eyelids are pale. The bill is mostly pale grey, with a dark culmen and tip, but in early spring the tip may turn whitish. The underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are also whitish. The foreneck is whitish, usually forming wedge-shaped notch in dark neck-sides, and may sometimes reveal a shadowy trace of the neck ring or a pale collar. It has dark brownish grey upperparts with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders and some wing coverts spotted with white, which are usually concealed while swimming. The male and the female have similar appearances, although they exhibit sexual dimorphism in their physical dimensions with the male larger and significantly heavier than the female.<br/><br/>The heavy dagger-like bill is evenly tapered and greyish, sometimes having a black tip. The bill colour and angle distinguish this species from the yellow-billed loon. The neck is short and thick. It swims very low in the water, with sometimes only its head held above and horizontal to water. It must run across the water surface to get in flight. During flight, its head is slightly lower than its body, with its feet trailing behind. It has a skeletal structure made up of a number of solid bones (this is usual for the Gaviiformes and penguins but unlike most flying birds which have bones with extensive pneumatization, hollow and filled with air to make the lighter), which adds weight but helps in diving.<br/><br/>A juvenile often has a dark, brownish-grey nape that may look darker than the pale-edged black feathers. It has a dark grey to black head, neck, and upperparts, with white throat, cheeks, and underparts. During the first winter, the bill shape of the young may not be as fully developed as that of the adult, and during the second winter, it much resembles the breeding adult, but with wing coverts lacking white spots.<br/><br/>The common loon is distinguished from the black-throated loon (<em>G. arctica</em>) and the red-throated loon (<em>G. stellata</em>) mainly by its larger size. It usually has a steeper forehead and a bulging forecrown, somewhat similar to the black-throated loon. Its bill is heavier and the back is paler than its hindneck. It is more difficult to separate from the yellow-billed loon, but its breeding plumage has more white markings on the neck and the squares on its shoulders are usually smaller; the non-breeding plumage has darker neck-sides contrasting more sharply with pale areas and bill colour.<br/><br/>The scaly juvenile plumage is retained until January or February of the year following hatching, when a lengthy moult of head and body feathers gives them a more adult-like appearance. Adults shed all their flight feathers simultaneously around this time, leaving them temporarily flightless, prior to gaining breeding plumage, but second-year birds delay this substantial moult until the summer. The adult winter plumage is attained between October and January by partial moult mainly of head, body and tail feathers",

			"Commonname": "European Storm-petrel",
			"Genus": "Hydrobates",
			"species": "pelagicus",
			"Description": "The <strong>European storm petrel</strong>, <strong>British storm petrel</strong> or just <strong>storm petrel</strong> (<em>Hydrobates pelagicus</em>) is a seabird in the northern storm petrel family, Hydrobatidae. It is the only member of the genus <em>Hydrobates</em>. The small, square-tailed bird is entirely black except for a broad white rump and a white band on the underwings, and it has a fluttering, bat-like flight. The large majority of the population breeds on islands off the coasts of Europe, with the greatest numbers in the Faroe Islands, United Kingdom, Ireland and Iceland. The Mediterranean population is a separate subspecies, but is inseparable at sea from its Atlantic relatives; its strongholds are Filfla Island (Malta), Sicily and the Balearic Islands.<br/><br/>The storm petrel nests in crevices and burrows, sometimes shared with other seabirds or rabbits, and lays a single white egg, usually on bare soil. The adults share the lengthy incubation and both feed the chick, which is not normally brooded after the first week. This bird is strongly migratory, spending the northern hemisphere winter mainly off the coasts of South Africa and Namibia, with some birds stopping in the seas adjoining West Africa, and a few remaining near their Mediterranean breeding islands. This petrel is strictly oceanic outside the breeding season. It feeds on small fish, squid and zooplankton while pattering on the sea's surface, and can find oily edible items by smell. The food is converted in the bird's stomach to an oily orange liquid which is regurgitated when the chick is fed. Although usually silent at sea, the storm petrel has a chattering call given by both members of a pair in their courtship flight, and the male has a purring song given from the breeding chamber.<br/><br/>The storm petrel cannot survive on islands where land mammals such as rats and cats have been introduced, and it suffers natural predation from gulls, skuas, owls and falcons. Although the population may be declining slightly, this petrel is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of Least Concern due to its high total numbers. Its presence in rough weather at sea has led to various mariners' superstitions, and, by analogy, to its use as a symbol by revolutionary and anarchist groups.<br/><br/>The storm petrel is a small bird, 14&ndash;18&nbsp;cm (5.5&ndash;7.1&nbsp;in) in length with a 36&ndash;39&nbsp;cm (14&ndash;15&nbsp;in) wingspan. It weighs 20&ndash;38&nbsp;g (0.71&ndash;1.34&nbsp;oz), with an average of 28&nbsp;g (0.99&nbsp;oz). It is square-tailed and has all-black plumage except for a snow-white rump that extends to the sides of the tail base and a broad white band on the underwings. Juveniles in fresh plumage can also show a narrow white bar on the upperwing. The plumage becomes dark brown rather than black as it becomes worn. There are no obvious differences between the sexes, although in the Mediterranean subspecies, at least, most captured birds can be sexed using a formula which involves multiplying the wing length by the length of the white rump band; females are slightly larger and have a longer white rump than males. The Mediterranean subspecies has longer wings and a heavier bill on average than the nominate form, but neither sex nor subspecies can be determined by observation at sea.<br/><br/>Moult is prolonged in all tubenoses, since they must maintain an ability to fly. Northern populations start replacing their plumage after those further south, reflecting the later start to their breeding season. Birds in a Welsh colony commenced moulting in early August, while populations in northern Spain and the Balearics started in early July and mid-June respectively. Breeding birds moult later than non-breeders.<br/><br/>The storm petrel's large nasal olfactory bulbs facilitate a keen sense of smell, and the birds themselves have a distinctive musty aroma which can help researchers to locate breeding colonies. Individual petrels recognise their own body scent and can use it to locate their nest in the dark.<br/><br/>The flight is weak-looking and resembles that of a bat, with fluttering interspersed with short glides. When feeding, the birds hang with raised wings and patter on the surface with their feet, but, unlike the Wilson's storm petrel, do not look as if they are walking on the water. Birds will sometimes settle on the sea. Like other petrels, the European storm petrel cannot walk properly on land, but shuffles on its tarsi; once there is enough room, the bird flaps its wings to support itself on its toes.<br/><br/>The European storm petrel can be distinguished from related Western Palaearctic species by the white bar on its underwing and its distinctive fluttering flight. Compared to Leach's storm petrel, band-rumped storm petrel, and the recently described Monteiro's storm petrel, it is also smaller, darker, shorter-winged and has a square tail. Wilson's storm petrel lacks an underwing bar, and has long legs with the feet visible beyond the tail.",

			"Description": "The <strong>Manx shearwater</strong> (<em>Puffinus puffinus</em>) is a medium-sized shearwater in the seabird family Procellariidae. The scientific name of this species records a name shift: <em>Manx shearwaters</em> were called <em>Manks puffins</em> in the 17th century. Puffin is an Anglo-Norman word (Middle English <em>pophyn</em>) for the cured carcasses of nestling shearwaters. The Atlantic puffin acquired the name much later, possibly because of its similar nesting habits.<br/><br/>The Manx shearwater is 30&ndash;38&nbsp;cm (12&ndash;15&nbsp;in) with a 76&ndash;89&nbsp;cm (30&ndash;35&nbsp;in) wingspan and weighs 350&ndash;575&nbsp;g (12.3&ndash;20.3&nbsp;oz).It has the typically \"shearing\" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wingbeats, the wingtips almost touching the water. This bird looks like a flying cross, with its wing held at right angles to the body, and it changes from black to white as the black upperparts and white undersides are alternately exposed as it travels low over the sea.<br/><br/>This shearwater is mainly silent at sea, even when birds are gathered off the breeding colonies. It calls on its nocturnal visits to the nesting burrows in flight, on the ground and in the burrows, although moonlight depresses the amount of calling. The vocalisations largely consists of a raucous series of croons, howls and screams, typically in groups of 4&ndash;5 syllables which become weaker and throatier. The male has some clear ringing and shrieking tones absent from the harsher repertoire of the female, the difference being obvious when a pair duets. Females can recognise the voice of their mate, but not of their young. They do not provide post-nesting care, and it is likely that a chick in the burrow is their own, so there is no need for voice identification.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Audubon's shearwater</strong> (<em>Puffinus lherminieri</em>) is a common tropical seabird in the petrel family. Sometimes known as the <strong>dusky-backed shearwater</strong>, the specific epithet honours the French naturalist F&eacute;lix Louis L'Herminier.<br/><br/>Certain populations are known variously as <strong>Baillon's shearwater</strong>, <strong>tropical shearwater</strong>, <strong>Bannerman's shearwater</strong>, <strong>Mascarene shearwater</strong> and <strong>Persian shearwater</strong>; some of these are considered distinct species by various authors. If they are all placed in <em>P. lherminieri</em>, the North Atlantic little shearwater (otherwise often separated as <em>P. baroli</em>) is generally included here too. Thus, these small shearwaters form a cryptic species complex.<br/><br/>Audubon's shearwaters are on average 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in length&mdash;about half the size of the greater shearwater (<em>Puffinus gravis</em>)&mdash;and weigh 170&nbsp;g. There is some variation between populations, and the normal size and weight range is 30&ndash;33&nbsp;cm (12&ndash;13&nbsp;in) and 150&ndash;230&nbsp;g (5.3&ndash;8.1&nbsp;oz). The wingspan is 64&ndash;72&nbsp;cm, the tail is around 8.5&nbsp;cm long, the exposed culmen measures 3&nbsp;cm or slightly less, and the tarsus is around 4&nbsp;cm in length. In general appearance, it is a small shearwater, black above and white below and hard to distinguish from its relatives at first glance.<br/><br/>The upperparts, rectrices and undertail coverts are blackish-brown, as are at least the distal undersides of the remiges, but sometimes the entire feathers. The rest of the underparts are white, as is the head below eye level. The iris is dark, the feet are dull pink with a black wash and black toenails, and the bill is grey, darker towards the tip, and with a pinkish hue.<br/><br/>Males and females look alike. Immature birds do not have a distinct plumage, while the nestlings are covered with down feathers, grey above and whitish on the belly.<br/><br/>It can be confused with the Manx shearwater (<em>P. puffinus</em>), which has white undertail coverts and in direct comparison a longer bill. Other similar-looking species are usually completely allopatric, though the largely subantarctic little shearwater (<em>P. assimilis</em>) may occasionally range into waters where <em>P. lherminieri</em> is normally found. It has more white on the face and underwing, a smaller bill and greyish-blue feet.<br/><br/>Its twittering calls and mewing are often only heard at night in the breeding colonies.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Yellow-billed stork</strong> (<em>Mycteria ibis</em>), sometimes also called the <strong>wood stork</strong> or <strong>wood ibis</strong>, is a large African wading stork species in the family Ciconiidae. It is widespread in regions south of the Sahara and also occurs in Madagascar.<br/><br/>It is a medium-sized stork standing 90&ndash;105&nbsp;cm (35&ndash;41&nbsp;in) tall. The body is white with a short black tail that is glossed green and purple when freshly moulted. The bill is deep yellow, slightly decurved at the end and has a rounder cross-section than in other stork species outside the <em>Mycteria</em>. Feathers extend onto the head and neck just behind the eyes, with the face and forehead being covered by deep red skin. Both sexes are similar in appearance, but the male is larger and has a slightly longer heavier bill. Males and females weigh approximately 2.3&nbsp;kg (5.1&nbsp;lb) and 1.9&nbsp;kg (4.2&nbsp;lb) respectively.<br/><br/>Colouration becomes more vivid during the breeding season. In the breeding season, the plumage is coloured pink on the upperwings and back; the ordinarily brown legs also turn bright pink; the bill becomes a deeper yellow and the face becomes a deeper red.<br/><br/>Juveniles are greyish-brown with a dull, partially bare, orange face and a dull yellowish bill. The legs and feet are brown and feathers all over the body are blackish-brown. At fledging, salmon-pink colouration in the underwings begins to develop and after about one year, the plumage is greyish-white. Flight feathers on the tail and wing also become black. Later, the pink colouration typical of adult plumage begins to appear.<br/><br/>These storks walk with a high-stepped stalking gait on the ground of shallow water and their approximate walking rate has been recorded as 70 steps per minute. They fly with alternating flaps and glides, with the speed of their flaps averaging 177&ndash;205 beats per minute. They usually flap only for short journeys and often fly in a soaring and gliding motion over several kilometres for locomotion between breeding colonies or roosts and feeding sites. By soaring on thermals and gliding by turns, they can cover large distances without wasting much energy. On descending from high altitudes, this stork has been observed to dive deeply at high speeds and flip over and over from side to side, hence showing impressive aerobatics. It even appears to enjoy these aerial stunts.<br/><br/>This species is generally non-vocal, but utters hissing falsetto screams during social displays in the breeding season. These storks also engage in bill clattering and an audible &ldquo;woofing&rdquo; wing beat at breeding colonies Nestlings make a loud continual monotonous braying call to beg parental adults for food.<br/><br/><sup>(From Wikipedia)</sup>",

			"Commonname": "Black Stork",
			"Genus": "Ciconia",
			"species": "nigra",
			"Description": "The <strong>black stork</strong> (<em>Ciconia nigra</em>) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his <em>Systema Naturae.</em> Measuring on average 95 to 100&nbsp;cm (37 to 39&nbsp;in) from beak tip to end of tail with a 145-to-155&nbsp;cm (57-to-61&nbsp;in) wingspan, the adult black stork has mainly black plumage, with white underparts, long red legs and a long pointed red beak. A widespread, but uncommon, species, it breeds in scattered locations across Europe (predominantly in Spain, and central and eastern parts), and Asia to the Pacific Ocean. It is a long-distance migrant, with European populations wintering in tropical Sub-Saharan Africa, and Asian populations in the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west. An isolated, non-migratory, population occurs in Southern Africa.<br/><br/>Unlike the closely related white stork, the black stork is a shy and wary species. It is seen singly or in pairs, usually in marshy areas, rivers or inland waters. It feeds on amphibians, small fish and insects, generally wading slowly in shallow water stalking its prey. Breeding pairs usually build nests in large forest trees&mdash;most commonly deciduous but also coniferous&mdash;which can be seen from long distances, as well as on large boulders, or under overhanging ledges in mountainous areas. The female lays two to five greyish-white eggs, which become soiled over time in the nest. Incubation takes 32 to 38 days,&nbsp;with both sexes sharing duties, and fledging takes 60 to 71 days.<br/><br/>The black stork is considered to be a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature, but its actual status is uncertain. Despite its large range, it is nowhere abundant, and it appears to be declining in parts of its range, such as in India, China and parts of Western Europe, though increasing in others such as the Iberian Peninsula. Various conservation measures have been taken for the black stork, like the Conservation Action Plan for African black storks by Wetlands International. It is also covered under the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.<br/><br/>The black stork is a large bird, measuring between 95 and 100&nbsp;cm (37 and 39&nbsp;in) in length with a 145-to-155&nbsp;cm (57-to-61&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighing around 3&nbsp;kg (6.6&nbsp;lb). Standing as tall as 102&nbsp;cm (40&nbsp;in), it has long red legs, a long neck and a long, straight, pointed red beak. It bears some resemblance to Abdim's stork (<em>C. abdimii</em>), which can be distinguished by its much smaller build, predominantly green bill, legs and feet, and white rump and lower back. The plumage is black with a purplish green sheen, except for the white lower breast, belly, armpits, axillaries and undertail coverts. The breast feathers are long and shaggy, forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The black stork has brown irises, and bare red skin around its eyes. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. Moulting takes place in spring, with the iridescent sheen brighter in new plumage. It walks slowly and steadily on the ground and like all storks, it flies with its neck outstretched.<br/><br/>The juvenile resembles the adult in plumage, but the areas corresponding to the adult black feathers are browner and less glossy. The scapulars, wing and upper tail coverts have pale tips. The legs, bill and bare skin around the eyes are greyish green. It could possibly be confused with the juvenile yellow-billed stork, but the latter has paler wings and mantle, a longer bill and white under the wings.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>white stork</strong> (<em>Ciconia ciconia</em>) is a large bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. Its plumage is mainly white, with black on its wings. Adults have long red legs and long pointed red beaks, and measure on average 100&ndash;115&nbsp;cm (39&ndash;45&nbsp;in) from beak tip to end of tail, with a 155&ndash;215&nbsp;cm (61&ndash;85&nbsp;in) wingspan. The two subspecies, which differ slightly in size, breed in Europe (north to Finland), northwestern Africa, southwestern Asia (east to southern Kazakhstan) and southern Africa. The white stork is a long-distance migrant, wintering in Africa from tropical Sub-Saharan Africa to as far south as South Africa, or on the Indian subcontinent. When migrating between Europe and Africa, it avoids crossing the Mediterranean Sea and detours via the Levant in the east or the Strait of Gibraltar in the west, because the air thermals on which it depends for soaring do not form over water.<br/><br/>A carnivore, the white stork eats a wide range of animal prey, including insects, fish, amphibians, reptiles, small mammals and small birds. It takes most of its food from the ground, among low vegetation, and from shallow water. It is a monogamous breeder, but does not pair for life. Both members of the pair build a large stick nest, which may be used for several years. Each year the female can lay one clutch of usually four eggs, which hatch asynchronously 33&ndash;34&nbsp;days after being laid. Both parents take turns incubating the eggs and both feed the young. The young leave the nest 58&ndash;64&nbsp;days after hatching, and continue to be fed by the parents for a further 7&ndash;20&nbsp;days.<br/><br/>The white stork has been rated as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It benefited from human activities during the Middle Ages as woodland was cleared, but changes in farming methods and industrialisation saw it decline and disappear from parts of Europe in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Conservation and reintroduction programs across Europe have resulted in the white stork resuming breeding in the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland and Sweden. It has few natural predators, but may harbour several types of parasite; the plumage is home to chewing lice and feather mites, while the large nests maintain a diverse range of mesostigmatic mites. This conspicuous species has given rise to many legends across its range, of which the best-known is the story of babies being brought by storks.<br/><br/>The white stork is a large bird. It has a length of 100&ndash;115&nbsp;cm (39&ndash;45&nbsp;in), and a standing height of 100&ndash;125&nbsp;cm (39&ndash;49&nbsp;in). The wingspan is 155&ndash;215&nbsp;cm (61&ndash;85&nbsp;in) and its weight is 2.3&ndash;4.5&nbsp;kg (5.1&ndash;9.9&nbsp;lb). Like all storks, it has long legs, a long neck and a long straight pointed beak. The sexes are identical in appearance, except that males are larger than females on average. The plumage is mainly white with black flight feathers and wing coverts; the black is caused by the pigment melanin. The breast feathers are long and shaggy forming a ruff which is used in some courtship displays. The irises are dull brown or grey, and the peri-orbital skin is black. The adult has a bright red beak and red legs, the colouration of which is derived from carotenoids in the diet. In parts of Spain, studies have shown that the pigment is based on astaxanthin obtained from an introduced species of crayfish (<em>Procambarus clarkii</em>) and the bright red beak colours show up even in nestlings, in contrast to the duller beaks of young white storks elsewhere.<br/><br/>As with other storks, the wings are long and broad enabling the bird to soar. In flapping flight its wingbeats are slow and regular. It flies with its neck stretched forward and with its long legs extended well beyond the end of its short tail. It walks at a slow and steady pace with its neck upstretched. In contrast, it often hunches its head between its shoulders when resting. Moulting has not been extensively studied, but appears to take place throughout the year, with the primary flight feathers replaced over the breeding season.<br/><br/>Upon hatching, the young white stork is partly covered with short, sparse, whitish down feathers. This early down is replaced about a week later with a denser coat of woolly white down. By three weeks, the young bird acquires black scapulars and flight feathers. On hatching the chick has pinkish legs, which turn to greyish-black as it ages. Its beak is black with a brownish tip. By the time it fledges, the juvenile bird's plumage is similar to that of the adult, though its black feathers are often tinged with brown, and its beak and legs are a duller brownish-red or orange. The beak is typically orange or red with a darker tip. The bills gain the adults' red colour the following summer, although the black tips persist in some individuals. Young storks adopt adult plumage by their second summer.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian bittern</strong> or <strong>great bittern</strong> (<em>Botaurus stellaris</em>) is a wading bird in the bittern subfamily (Botaurinae) of the heron family Ardeidae. There are two subspecies, the northern race (<em>B. s. stellaris</em>) breeding in parts of Europe and Asia, as well as on the northern coast of Africa, while the southern race (<em>B. s. capensis</em>) is endemic to parts of southern Africa. It is a secretive bird, seldom seen in the open as it prefers to skulk in reed beds and thick vegetation near water bodies. Its presence is apparent in the spring, when the booming call of the male during the breeding season can be heard. It feeds on fish, small mammals, fledgling birds, amphibians, crustaceans and insects.<br/><br/>The nest is usually built among reeds at the edge of bodies of water. The female incubates the clutch of eggs and feeds the young chicks, which leave the nest when about two weeks old. She continues to care for them until they are fully fledged some six weeks later.<br/><br/>With its specific habitat requirements and the general reduction in wetlands across its range, the population is thought to be in decline globally. However the decline is slow, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its overall conservation status as being of \"least concern\". Nevertheless, some local populations are at risk and the population of the southern race has declined more dramatically and is cause for concern. In the United Kingdom it is one of the most threatened of all bird species.<br/><br/>Bitterns are thickset herons with bright, pale, buffy-brown plumage covered with dark streaks and bars As its alternate name suggests, this species is the largest of the bitterns, with males being rather larger than females. The Eurasian or great bittern is 69&ndash;81&nbsp;cm (27&ndash;32&nbsp;in) in length, with a 100&ndash;130&nbsp;cm (39&ndash;51&nbsp;in) wingspan and a body mass of 0.87&ndash;1.94&nbsp;kg (1.9&ndash;4.3&nbsp;lb).<br/><br/>The crown and nape are black, with the individual feathers rather long and loosely arranged, tipped with buff narrowly barred with black. The sides of the head and neck are a more uniform tawny-buff, irregularly barred with black. The mantle, scapulars and back are of a similar colour but are more heavily barred, the individual feathers having black centres and barring. The head has a yellowish-buff superciliary stripe and a brownish-black moustachial stripe. The sides of the neck are a rusty-brown with faint barring. The chin and throat are buff, the central feathers on the throat having longitudinal stripes of rusty-brown. The breast and belly are yellowish-buff, with broad stripes of brown at the side and narrow stripes in the centre. The tail is rusty-buff with black streaks in the centre and black mottling near the edge. The wings are pale rusty-brown irregularly barred, streaked and mottled with black. The plumage has a loose texture, and elongated feathers on the crown, neck and breast can be erected. The powerful bill is greenish-yellow with a darker tip to the upper mandible. The eye has a yellow iris and is surrounded by a ring of greenish or bluish bare skin. The legs and feet are greenish, with some yellow on the tarsal joint and yellow soles to the feet. Juveniles have similar plumage to adults but are somewhat paler with less distinct markings.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Birds from temperate regions in Europe and western Asia are migratory, wintering in Africa and further south in Asia, while those nesting in the tropics are sedentary. It is rare north of its breeding range.<br/><br/><sup>It is a very small bittern; measuring 25&ndash;36&nbsp;cm (9.8&ndash;14.2&nbsp;in) in length, 40&ndash;58&nbsp;cm (16&ndash;23&nbsp;in) across the wings and weighing 59&ndash;150&nbsp;g (2.1&ndash;5.3&nbsp;oz). It is among the smallest heron species. It has a short neck, longish bill and buff underparts. The male's back and crown are black, and the wings are black with a large white patch on each wing. The female has a browner back and a buff-brown wing patch.</sup><br/><br/>FromWikipedia",

They have a black crown and back with the remainder of the body white or grey, red eyes, and short yellow legs. They have pale grey wings and white under parts. Two or three long white plumes, erected in greeting and courtship displays, extend from the back of the head. The sexes are similar in appearance although the males are slightly larger. Black-crowned night herons do not fit the typical body form of the heron family. They are relatively stocky with shorter bills, legs, and necks than their more familiar cousins, the egrets and \"day\" herons. Their resting posture is normally somewhat hunched but when hunting they extend their necks and look more like other wading birds.<br/><br/>Immature birds have dull grey-brown plumage on their heads, wings, and backs, with numerous pale spots. Their underparts are paler and streaked with brown. The young birds have orange eyes and duller yellowish-green legs. They are very noisy birds in their nesting colonies, with calls that are commonly transcribed as <em>quok</em> or <em>woc</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>western cattle egret</strong> (<em>Bubulcus ibis</em>) is a species of heron (family Ardeidae) found in the tropics, subtropics and warm temperate zones. Most taxonomic authorites lump this species and the eastern cattle egret together (called the cattle egret), but some (including the International Ornithologists' Union separate them. Despite the similarities in plumage to the egrets of the genus <em>Egretta</em>, it is more closely related to the herons of <em>Ardea</em>. Originally native to parts of Asia, Africa and Europe, it has undergone a rapid expansion in its distribution and successfully colonised much of the rest of the world in the last century.<br/><br/>It is a white bird adorned with buff plumes in the breeding season. It nests in colonies, usually near bodies of water and often with other wading birds. The nest is a platform of sticks in trees or shrubs. Western cattle egrets exploit drier and open habitats more than other heron species. Their feeding habitats include seasonally inundated grasslands, pastures, farmlands, wetlands and rice paddies. They often accompany cattle or other large mammals, catching insect and small vertebrate prey disturbed by these animals. Some populations of the cattle egret are migratory and others show post-breeding dispersal.<br/><br/>The adult cattle egret has few predators, but birds or mammals may raid its nests, and chicks may be lost to starvation, calcium deficiency or disturbance from other large birds. This species maintains a special relationship with cattle, which extends to other large grazing mammals; wider human farming is believed to be a major cause of their suddenly expanded range. The cattle egret removes ticks and flies from cattle and consumes them. This benefits both species, but it has been implicated in the spread of tick-borne animal diseases.<br/><br/>The cattle egret is a stocky heron with an 88&ndash;96&nbsp;cm (35&ndash;38&nbsp;in) wingspan; it is 46&ndash;56&nbsp;cm (18&ndash;22&nbsp;in) long and weighs 270&ndash;512&nbsp;g (9.5&ndash;18.1&nbsp;oz). It has a relatively short thick neck, a sturdy bill, and a hunched posture. The non-breeding adult has mainly white plumage, a yellow bill and greyish-yellow legs. During the breeding season, adults of the nominate western subspecies develop orange-buff plumes on the back, breast and crown, and the bill, legs and irises become bright red for a brief period prior to pairing. The sexes are similar, but the male is marginally larger and has slightly longer breeding plumes than the female; juvenile birds lack coloured plumes and have a black bill.<br/><br/>The positioning of the egret's eyes allows for binocular vision during feeding, and physiological studies suggest that the species may be capable of crepuscular or nocturnal activity. Adapted to foraging on land, they have lost the ability possessed by their wetland relatives to accurately correct for light refraction by water.<br/><br/>This species gives a quiet, throaty <em>rick-rack</em> call at the breeding colony, but is otherwise largely silent.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>grey heron</strong> (<em>Ardea cinerea</em>) is a long-legged predatory wading bird of the heron family, Ardeidae, native throughout temperate Europe and Asia and also parts of Africa. It is resident in much of its range, but some populations from the more northern parts migrate southwards in autumn. A bird of wetland areas, it can be seen around lakes, rivers, ponds, marshes and on the sea coast. It feeds mostly on aquatic creatures which it catches after standing stationary beside or in the water or stalking its prey through the shallows.<br/><br/>Standing up to a metre tall, adults weigh from 1 to 2&nbsp;kg (2.2 to 4.4&nbsp;lb). They have a white head and neck with a broad black stripe that extends from the eye to the black crest. The body and wings are grey above and the underparts are greyish-white, with some black on the flanks. The long, sharply pointed beak is pinkish-yellow and the legs are brown.<br/><br/>The birds breed colonially in spring in \"heronries\", usually building their nests high in trees. A clutch of usually three to five bluish-green eggs is laid. Both birds incubate the eggs for a period of about 25 days, and then both feed the chicks, which fledge when seven or eight weeks old. Many juveniles do not survive their first winter, but if they do, they can expect to live for about five years.<br/><br/>The grey heron is a large bird, standing up to 100&nbsp;cm (39&nbsp;in) tall and measuring 84&ndash;102&nbsp;cm (33&ndash;40&nbsp;in) long with a 155&ndash;195&nbsp;cm (61&ndash;77&nbsp;in) wingspan. The body weight can range from 1.02&ndash;2.08&nbsp;kg (2.2&ndash;4.6&nbsp;lb). The plumage is largely ashy-grey above, and greyish-white below with some black on the flanks. Adults have the head and neck white with a broad black supercilium that terminates in the slender, dangling crest, and bluish-black streaks on the front of the neck. The scapular feathers are elongated and the feathers at the base of the neck are also somewhat elongated. Immature birds lack the dark stripe on the head and are generally duller in appearance than adults, with a grey head and neck, and a small, dark grey crest. The pinkish-yellow beak is long, straight and powerful, and is brighter in colour in breeding adults. The iris is yellow and the legs are brown and very long.<br/><br/>The main call is a loud croaking \"fraaank\", but a variety of guttural and raucous noises are heard at the breeding colony. The male uses an advertisement call to encourage a female to join him at the nest, and both sexes use various greeting calls after a pair bond has been established. A loud, harsh \"schaah\" is used by the male in driving other birds from the vicinity of the nest and a soft \"gogogo\" expresses anxiety, as when a predator is nearby or a human walks past the colony. The chicks utter loud chattering or ticking noises.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>purple heron</strong> (<em>Ardea purpurea</em>) is a wide ranging species of wading bird in the heron family, Ardeidae. The scientific name comes from Latin <em>ardea</em> \"heron\", and <em>purpureus</em>, \"coloured purple\". It breeds in Africa, central and southern Europe, and southern and eastern Asia. The Western Palearctic populations migrate between breeding and wintering habitats whereas the African and tropical-Asian populations are primarily sedentary, except for occasional dispersive movements.<br/><br/>It is similar in appearance to the more common grey heron but is slightly smaller, more slender and has darker plumage. It is also a more evasive bird, favouring densely vegetated habitats near water, particularly reed beds. It hunts for a range of prey including fish, rodents, frogs and insects, either stalking them or standing waiting in ambush.<br/><br/>Purple herons are colonial breeders and build a bulky nest out of dead reeds or sticks close to the water' edge among reeds or in dense vegetation. About five bluish-green eggs are laid and are incubated by both birds. The young hatch about four weeks later and fledge six weeks after that. The International Union for Conservation of Nature notes that the global population trend is downwards, largely because of the drainage of wetlands, but assesses the purple heron's conservation status as being of \"least concern\".<br/><br/>The purple heron is a large bird, 78&ndash;97&nbsp;cm (31&ndash;38&nbsp;in) in length with a standing height from 70 to 94&nbsp;cm (28 to 37&nbsp;in) and a 120&ndash;152&nbsp;cm (47&ndash;60&nbsp;in) wingspan. However, it is slender for its size, weighing only 0.5 to 1.35&nbsp;kg (1.1 to 3.0&nbsp;lb). It is somewhat smaller than the grey heron, from which it can be distinguished by its darker reddish-brown plumage, and, in adults, its darker grey back. Adults have the forehead and the crown of the head black, with a dark stripe down the back of the neck that terminates in a slender, dangling crest. This is shorter than the crest of the grey heron and does not exceed 140&nbsp;mm (5.5&nbsp;in). The sides of the head and the neck are buffish chestnut, with dark streaks and lines down either side of the whole the neck. The mantle is oily brown and the upper scapular feathers are elongated but not the lower ones. The rest of the upper parts and the tail are brownish grey. The front of the neck is paler than the sides and there are some elongated feathers at the base of the neck which are streaked with white, chestnut and black. The breast is chestnut brown, with some blackening at the side, and the belly and under-tail coverts are black. The brownish-yellow beak is long, straight and powerful, and is brighter in colour in breeding adults. The iris is yellow and the legs are brown at the front and yellowish behind.<br/><br/>The call is a harsh \"frarnk\", but is quieter and more high-pitched than that of the grey heron. It is generally a less noisy bird, though similar guttural sounds are heard emanating from the heronry. It is also less robust, and appears somewhat hollow-chested. Its head and neck are more slender and snake-like than the grey heron and its toes much longer. Unlike that bird, it often adopts a posture with its neck extending obliquely, and even nestlings tend to use this stance<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>great egret</strong> (<em><strong>Ardea alba</strong></em>), also known as the <strong>common egret</strong>, <strong>large egret</strong> or (in the Old World) <strong>great white egret</strong> or <strong>great white heron</strong> is a large, widely distributed egret, with four subspecies found in Asia, Africa, the Americas, and southern Europe. Distributed across most of the tropical and warmer temperate regions of the world. It builds tree nests in colonies close to water.<br/><br/>The great egret is a large heron with all-white plumage. Standing up to 1&nbsp;m (3.3&nbsp;ft) tall, this species can measure 80 to 104&nbsp;cm (31 to 41&nbsp;in) in length and have a wingspan of 131 to 170&nbsp;cm (52 to 67&nbsp;in). Body mass can range from 700 to 1,500&nbsp;g (1.5 to 3.3&nbsp;lb), with an average of around 1,000&nbsp;g (2.2&nbsp;lb). It is thus only slightly smaller than the great blue or grey heron (<em>A. cinerea</em>). Apart from size, the great egret can be distinguished from other white egrets by its yellow bill and black legs and feet, though the bill may become darker and the lower legs lighter in the breeding season. In breeding plumage, delicate ornamental feathers are borne on the back. Males and females are identical in appearance; juveniles look like non-breeding adults. Differentiated from the intermediate egret (<em>Mesophoyx intermedius</em>) by the gape, which extends well beyond the back of the eye in case of the great egret, but ends just behind the eye in case of the intermediate egret.<br/><br/>It has a slow flight, with its neck retracted. This is characteristic of herons and bitterns, and distinguishes them from storks, cranes, ibises, and spoonbills, which extend their necks in flight. The great egret walks with its neck extended and wings held close. The great egret is not normally a vocal bird; it gives a low hoarse croak when disturbed, and at breeding colonies, it often gives a loud croaking <em>cuk cuk cuk</em> and higher-pitched squawks.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>little egret</strong> (<em>Egretta garzetta</em>) is a species of small heron in the family Ardeidae. The genus name comes from the Proven&ccedil;al French <em>Aigrette</em>, \"egret\", a diminutive of <em>Aigron</em>,\" heron\". The species epithet <em>garzetta</em> is from the Italian name for this bird, <em>garzetta</em> or <em>sgarzetta</em>.<br/><br/>It is a white bird with a slender black beak, long black legs and, in the western race, yellow feet. As an aquatic bird, it feeds in shallow water and on land, consuming a variety of small creatures. It breeds colonially, often with other species of water birds, making a platform nest of sticks in a tree, bush or reed bed. A clutch of bluish-green eggs is laid and incubated by both parents. The young fledge at about six weeks of age.<br/><br/>Its breeding distribution is in wetlands in warm temperate to tropical parts of Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. A successful colonist, its range has gradually expanded north, with stable and self-sustaining populations now present in the United Kingdom.<br/><br/>In warmer locations, most birds are permanent residents; northern populations, including many European birds, migrate to Africa and southern Asia to over-winter there. The birds may also wander north in late summer after the breeding season, and their tendency to disperse may have assisted in the recent expansion of the bird's range. At one time common in Western Europe, it was hunted extensively in the 19th century to provide plumes for the decoration of hats and became locally extinct in northwestern Europe and scarce in the south. Around 1950, conservation laws were introduced in southern Europe to protect the species and their numbers began to increase. By the beginning of the 21st century the bird was breeding again in France, the Netherlands, Ireland and Britain. It has also begun to colonise the New World; it was first seen in Barbados in 1954 and first bred there in 1994. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed the bird's global conservation status as being of \"least concern\".<br/><br/>The adult little egret is 55&ndash;65&nbsp;cm (22&ndash;26&nbsp;in) long with an 88&ndash;106&nbsp;cm (35&ndash;42&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighs 350&ndash;550&nbsp;g (12&ndash;19&nbsp;oz). Its plumage is normally entirely white, although there are dark forms with largely bluish-grey plumage.<sup></sup> In the breeding season, the adult has two long plumes on the nape that form a crest. These plumes are about 150&nbsp;mm (6&nbsp;in) and are pointed and very narrow. There are similar feathers on the breast, but the barbs are more widely spread. There are also several elongated scapular feathers that have long loose barbs and may be 200&nbsp;mm (8&nbsp;in) long. During the winter the plumage is similar but the scapulars are shorter and more normal in appearance. The bill is long and slender and it and the lores are black. There is an area of greenish-grey bare skin at the base of the lower mandible and around the eye which has a yellow iris. The legs are black and the feet yellow. Juveniles are similar to non-breeding adults but have greenish-black legs and duller yellow feet, and may have a certain proportion of greyish or brownish feathers. The subspecies <em>nigripes</em> differs in having yellow skin between the bill and eye, and blackish feet. During the height of courtship, the lores turn red and the feet of the yellow-footed races turn red.<br/><br/>Little egrets are mostly silent but make various croaking and bubbling calls at their breeding colonies and produce a harsh alarm call when disturbed. To the human ear, the sounds are indistinguishable from the black-crowned night heron (<em>Nycticorax nycticorax</em>) and the cattle egret (<em>Bubulcus ibis</em>) with which it sometimes associates<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>northern gannet</strong> (<em>Morus bassanus</em>) is a seabird and the largest member of the gannet family, Sulidae. \"Gannet\" is derived from Old English <em>ganot</em> \"strong or masculine\", ultimately from the same Old Germanic root as \"gander\". <em>Morus</em> is derived from Ancient Greek <em>moros</em>, \"foolish\" due to the lack of fear shown by breeding gannets and boobies allowing them to be easily killed. The specific <em>bassanus</em> is from the Bass Rock in the Firth of Forth, which holds the world's largest colony of northern gannets.<br/><br/>The northern gannet has the same colours as the Australasian gannet and is similar in appearance. Nesting in colonies as large as 75,000 pairs on both sides of the north Atlantic this bird undertakes seasonal migrations and is a spectacular high-speed diver.<br/><br/>Old names for the northern gannet include <strong>solan</strong> and <strong>solan goose</strong>.<br/><br/>Adults are 81&ndash;110&nbsp;cm (32&ndash;43&nbsp;in) long, weigh 2.2&ndash;3.6&nbsp;kg (4.9&ndash;7.9&nbsp;lb) and have a 165&ndash;180&nbsp;cm (65&ndash;71&nbsp;in) wingspan. Before fledging, the immature birds (at about 10 weeks of age) can weigh more than 4&nbsp;kg (8.8&nbsp;lb). Each wing measures between 47 and 53&nbsp;cm (19 and 21&nbsp;in) when outstretched and the beak measures between 9 and 11&nbsp;cm (3.5 and 4.3&nbsp;in) (measured from the head). The two sexes are a similar size.<br/><br/>The plumage of the adults is white with dark wing tips, with colours that range from brown to black. The colour of the head, cheeks and side of the neck depends on the season and the individual; during breeding, the head and neck are brushed in a delicate yellow, although this colouring may not be evident in some individuals. The feathers are waterproof, which allows the birds to spend long periods in water. A water-impermeable secretion produced by a sebaceous gland covers the feathers and the birds spread it across their body using their beak or their head. The eye is light blue, and it is surrounded by bare, black skin, which gives the birds their characteristic facial expression.<br/><br/>Fledglings are brown with white wing tips. They have white spots on their head and on their back and a v-shaped white area underneath. The plumage of one-year-olds can be almost completely brown. In the second year the birds&rsquo; appearance changes depending on the different phases of moulting: they can have adult plumage at the front and continue to be brown at the rear. They gradually acquire more white in subsequent seasons until they reach maturity after five years.<br/><br/>Newborn chicks are featherless and are dark blue or black in colour. In the second week of life they are covered in white down. From the fifth week they are covered in dark brown feathers flecked with white.<br/><br/>Their beak is long, strong and conical with a slight downward curve at the end. The front part has a sharp edge. In adults, the beak is blue-grey with dark grey or black edges. It is brownish in immature birds.<br/><br/>The northern gannet&rsquo;s eyes are large and point forwards, and they have a light blue to light grey iris surrounded by a thin black ring. The four toes of their feet are joined by a membrane that can vary from dark grey to dark brown. There are yellow lines running along the toes that continue along their legs; these lines probably have a role in mating. The rear toe is strong and faces inwards allowing the birds to firmly grip onto vertical cliff faces.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>European shag</strong> or <strong>common shag</strong> (<em>Phalacrocorax aristotelis</em>) is a species of cormorant. It breeds around the rocky coasts of western and southern Europe, southwest Asia and north Africa, mainly wintering in its breeding range except for the northernmost birds. In Britain this seabird is usually referred to as simply the <strong>shag</strong>. The scientific genus name is Latinised Ancient Greek, from &phi;&alpha;&lambda;&alpha;&kappa;&rho;?&sigmaf; (<em>phalakros</em>, \"bald\") and &kappa;?&rho;&alpha;&xi; (<em>korax</em>, \"raven\"). The species name <em>aristotelis</em> commemorates the Greek philosopher Aristotle.<br/><br/>This is a medium-large black bird, 68 to 78&nbsp;cm (27 to 31&nbsp;in) long and with a 95-to-110-centimetre (37 to 43&nbsp;in) wingspan. It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have a small crest in the breeding season. It is distinguished from the great cormorant by its smaller size, lighter build, thinner bill, and, in breeding adults, by the crest and metallic green-tinged sheen on the feathers. Among those differences are that a shag has a lighter, narrower beak; and the juvenile shag has darker underparts. The European shag's tail has 12 feathers, the great cormorant's 14 feathers. The green sheen on the feathers results in the alternative name <strong>green cormorant</strong> sometimes being given to the European shag.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Weight is reported to vary from 1.5&nbsp;kg (3.3&nbsp;lb) to 5.3&nbsp;kg (12&nbsp;lb). Males are typically larger and heavier than females, with the nominate race (<em>P. c. carbo</em>) averaging about 10% larger in linear measurements than the smallest race in Europe (<em>P. c. sinensis</em>). The lightest average weights cited are in Germany (<em>P. c. sinensis</em>), where 36 males averaged 2.28&nbsp;kg (5.0&nbsp;lb) and 17 females averaged 1.94&nbsp;kg (4.3&nbsp;lb). The highest come from Prince Edward Island in Canada (<em>P. c. carbo</em>), where 11 males averaged 3.68&nbsp;kg (8.1&nbsp;lb) and 11 females averaged 2.94&nbsp;kg (6.5&nbsp;lb). Length can vary from 70 to 102&nbsp;cm (28 to 40&nbsp;in) and wingspan from 121 to 160&nbsp;cm (48 to 63&nbsp;in). They are tied as the second largest extant species of cormorant after the flightless cormorant, with the Japanese cormorant averaging at a similar size. In bulk if not in linear dimensions, the Blue-eyed shag species complex of the Southern Oceans are scarcely smaller at average. It has a longish tail and yellow throat-patch. Adults have white patches on the thighs and on the throat in the breeding season. In European waters it can be distinguished from the common shag by its larger size, heavier build, thicker bill, lack of a crest and plumage without any green tinge. In eastern North America, it is similarly larger and bulkier than double-crested cormorant, and the latter species has more yellow on the throat and bill and lack the white thigh patches frequently seen on great cormorants. Great cormorants are mostly silent, but they make various guttural noises at their breeding colonies.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is the most widespread of the oystercatchers, with three races breeding in western Europe, central Eurasia, Kamchatka, China, and the western coast of Korea. No other oystercatcher occurs within this area.<br/><br/>The oystercatcher is one of the largest waders in the region.

They are obvious and noisy plover-like birds, with black and white plumage, red legs and strong broad red bills used for smashing or prising open molluscs such as mussels or for finding earthworms.

The bird still lives up to its name, as few if any other wading birds are capable of opening oysters at all.<br/><br/>This oystercatcher is unmistakable in flight, with white patches on the wings and tail, otherwise black upperparts, and white underparts. Young birds are more brown, have a white neck collar and a duller bill. The call is a distinctive loud piping.<br/><br/>The bill shape varies; oystercatchers with broad bill tips open molluscs by prising them apart or hammering through the shell, whereas pointed-bill birds dig up worms. Much of this is due to the wear resulting from feeding on the prey. Individual birds specialise in one technique or the other which they learn from their parents.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Kentish plover</strong> (<em>Charadrius alexandrinus</em>) is a small cosmopolitan shorebird (40-44 g) of the family <em>Charadriidae</em> that breeds on the shores of saline lakes, lagoons, and coasts, populating sand dunes, marshes, semi-arid desert, and tundra. Both male and female birds have pale plumages with a white underside, grey/brown back, dark legs and a dark bill, however additionally the male birds also exhibit very dark incomplete breast bands, and dark markings either side of their head, therefore the Kentish plover is regarded as sexually dimorphic<br/><br/>Until 2009, the Kentish plover species was universally thought to include the North American snowy plover species, however a novel genetic research paper suggested that they were in fact separate species. In July 2011, the International Ornithological Congress (IOC), and the American Ornithologists' Union (AOU) pronounced the Snowy Plover as a separate species <em>Charadrius nivosus</em>.<br/><br/><em>Charadrius alexandrinus</em> has a large geographical distribution, ranging from latitudes of 10&ordm; to 55&ordm;, occupying North Africa, both mainland, such as Senegal, and island, such as the Cape Verde archipelago, Central Asia, for example alkaline lakes in China, and Europe, including small populations in Spain and Austria. Some populations are migratory and often winter in Africa, whereas other populations, such as various island populations, do not migrate.<br/><br/>Kentish plovers are ground-nesting birds, often with a preference for low, open, moist nesting sites away from thick vegetation and human activity. They use a number of materials to build their nests, mainly consisting of shells, pebbles, grass and leaves in a small scrape in the ground. Like most plovers, the Kentish plovers are predominantly insectivores, feeding on a large range of arthropods and invertebrates depending on the environment, by using a run and stop method.<br/><br/>The Kentish plover is a small shorebird weighing around 40g as an adult. Both male and female birds have black bills and dark legs, however adults have dimorphic plumage. During the breeding season, males have a black horizontal head bar, two incomplete dark breast-bands on each side of their breast, black ear coverts and a rufous nape and crown (although there is some variation between breeding populations), whereas the females are paler in these areas, without the dark markings. In the early breeding season, it is easy to distinguish between males and females since the ornaments are very pronounced, but as the breeding season progresses, the differences between the two sexes decrease. Moreover, males have longer tarsi and longer flank feathers than females. Longer flank feathers are thought to be an advantage for incubation and brood care, as the quality of feathers is associated with heat insulation. There are multiple significant predictors of plumage ornamentation in Kentish plovers. Firstly, the interaction between the advancement of the breeding season and rainfall seem to affect ornamentation. Male ornaments become more elaborated over the course of a breeding season in regions with high rainfall, whereas in regions with low rainfall, male ornaments become lighter. Secondly, the interaction between the breeding system and the sex can predict the degree of plumage ornamentation. In polygamous populations, the sexual ornaments are more pronounced, generating a stronger sexual dimorphism than in monogamous populations. The difference is especially witnessed in males, whereby the ornaments are darker and smaller in polygamous populations compared to monogamous populations, where males have lighter and larger ornaments. This is thought to be the result of a trade-off between the size and intensity of the ornaments.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It has rounded wings and a crest. It is also the shortest-legged of the lapwings. It is mainly black and white, but the back is tinted green. The male has a long crest and a black crown, throat and breast contrasting with an otherwise white face. Females and young birds have shorter crests, and have less strongly marked heads, but plumages are otherwise quite similar.<br/><br/>This is a vocal bird in the breeding season, with constant calling as the crazed tumbling display flight is performed by the male. The typical contact call is a loud, shrill \"pee-wit\" from which they get their other name of <strong>peewit</strong>. Displaying males usually make a wheezy \"pee-wit, wit wit, eeze wit\" during their display flight, these birds also make squeaking or mewing sounds.<br/><br/>It feeds primarily on insects and other small invertebrates. This species often feeds in mixed flocks with golden plovers and black-headed gulls, the latter often robbing the two plovers, but providing a degree of protection against predators.<br/><br/>Like the golden plovers, this species prefers to feed at night when there is moonlight.<br/><br/>The northern lapwing is one of the species to which the <em>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</em> (AEWA) applies.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is one of the most widespread of the curlews, breeding across much of subarctic North America, Europe and Asia as far south as Scotland.<br/><br/>This is a migratory species wintering on coasts in Africa, South America, south Asia into Australasia and southern North America. It is also a coastal bird during migration. It is fairly gregarious outside the breeding season.<br/><br/>This is a fairly large wader though mid-sized as a member of the curlew genus. The English name is imitative of the bird's call. The genus name <em>Numenius</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>noumenios</em>, a bird mentioned by Hesychius. It is associated with the curlews because it appears to be derived from <em>neos</em>, \"new\" and <em>mene</em> \"moon\", referring to the crescent-shaped bill. The species name <em>phaeopus</em> is the Medieval Latin name for the bird, from Ancient Greek <em>phaios</em>, \"dusky\" and <em>pous</em>, \"foot\".<br/><br/>It is 37&ndash;47&nbsp;cm (15&ndash;19&nbsp;in) in length, 75&ndash;90&nbsp;cm (30&ndash;35&nbsp;in) in wingspan, and 270&ndash;493&nbsp;g (9.5&ndash;17.4&nbsp;oz) in weight. It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back and rump (subspecies <em>N. p. phaeopus</em> and <em>N. p. alboaxillaris</em> only), and a long curved bill (longest in the adult female) with a kink rather than a smooth curve. It is generally wary.<br/><br/>The usual call is a rippling whistle, prolonged into a trill for the song.<br/><br/>The only similar common species over most of this bird's range are larger curlews. The whimbrel is smaller, has a shorter, decurved bill and has a central crown stripe and strong supercilia.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>slender-billed curlew</strong> (<em>Numenius tenuirostris</em>) is a bird in the wader family Scolopacidae. It breeds in marshes and peat bogs in the taiga of Siberia, and is migratory, formerly wintering in shallow freshwater habitats around the Mediterranean. This species has occurred as a vagrant in western Europe, the Canary Islands, the Azores, Oman, Canada and Japan.<br/><br/>The slender-billed curlew is a small curlew, 36&ndash;41&nbsp;cm in length with a 77&ndash;88&nbsp;cm wingspan. It is therefore about the same size as a whimbrel, but it is more like the Eurasian curlew in plumage. The breeding adult is mainly greyish brown above, with a whitish rump and lower back. The underparts are whitish, heavily streaked with dark brown. The flanks have round or heart-shaped spots. The non-breeding plumage is similar, but with fewer flank spots. Male and female are alike in plumage, but females are longer-billed than males, an adaptation in curlew species that eliminates direct competition for food between the sexes. The juvenile plumage is very similar to the adult, but the flank are marked with brown streaking, the heart-shaped spots only appearing toward the end of the first winter.<br/><br/>Compared to the Eurasian curlew, the slender-billed curlew is whiter on the breast, tail, and underwing, and the bill is shorter, more slender, and slightly straighter at the base. The arrowhead-shaped flank spots of the Eurasian curlew also are different from the round or heart-shaped spots of the slender-billed. The head pattern, with a dark cap and whitish supercilium, recalls that of the whimbrel, but that species also has a central crown stripe and a more clearly marked pattern overall; the pattern of the slender-billed curlew would be hard to make out in the field.<br/><br/>This species shows more white than other curlews, and the white underwings, along with the distinctive flank markings, are key identification criteria.<br/><br/>The call is a <em>cour-lee</em>, similar to that of the Eurasian curlew, but higher-pitched, more melodic, and shorter. The alarm call is a fast <em>cu-ee</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)<br/><br/>The best way to keep your JS files tidy is using the free online JavaScript formatter program.",

In Europe, this species is often referred to just as the \"curlew\", and in Scotland known as the \"whaup\" in Scots.<br/><br/>This is the largest wader in its range, at 50&ndash;60&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;24&nbsp;in) in length, with an 89&ndash;106&nbsp;cm (35&ndash;42&nbsp;in) wingspan and a body weight of 410&ndash;1,360&nbsp;g (0.90&ndash;3.00&nbsp;lb). It is mainly greyish brown, with a white back, greyish-blue legs and a very long curved bill. Males and females look identical, but the bill is longest in the adult female. It is generally not possible to recognize the sex of a single Eurasian curlew, or even several ones, as there is much variation; telling male and female of a mated pair apart is usually possible however.<br/><br/>The familiar call is a loud <em>curloo-oo</em>.<br/><br/>The only similar species over most of the curlew's range is the whimbrel (<em>N. phaeopus</em>). The whimbrel is smaller and has a shorter bill with a kink rather than a smooth curve. Flying curlews may also resemble, albeit not existing in the same area, bar-tailed godwits (<em>Limosa lapponica</em>) in their winter plumages; however, the latter have a smaller body, a slightly upturned beak, and legs that do not reach far beyond their tail tips. The Eurasian curlew's feet are longer, forming a conspicuous \"point\".<br/><br/>The curlew exists as a migratory species over most of its range, wintering in Africa, southern Europe and south Asia. Occasionally a vagrant individual reaches places far from its normal range, such as Nova Scotia and the Marianas.

The genus name <em>Limosa</em> is from Latin and means \"muddy\", from <em>limus</em>, \"mud\". The specific <em>lapponica</em> refers to Lapland. The English term \"godwit\" was first recorded in about 1416&ndash;7 and is believed to imitate the bird's call.<br/><br/>The bar-tailed godwit breeds on Arctic coasts and tundra mainly in the Old World, and winters on coasts in temperate and tropical regions of the Old World and of Australia and New Zealand. Its migration includes the longest known non-stop flight of any bird and also the longest journey without pausing to feed by any animal.<br/><br/>The bar-tailed godwit is a relatively short-legged species of godwit. The bill-to-tail length is 37&ndash;41&nbsp;cm (15&ndash;16&nbsp;in), with a wingspan of 70&ndash;80&nbsp;cm (28&ndash;31&nbsp;in). Males average smaller than females but with much overlap; males weigh 190&ndash;400&nbsp;g (6.7&ndash;14.1&nbsp;oz), while females weigh 260&ndash;630&nbsp;g (9.2&ndash;22.2&nbsp;oz); there is also some regional variation in size (see subspecies, below). The adult has blue-grey legs and a slightly upturned bi-colored bill, pink at the base and black towards the tip. The neck, breast and belly are unbroken brick red in breeding plumage, off white in winter. The back is mottled grey.<br/><br/>It is distinguished from the black-tailed godwit (<em>Limosa limosa</em>) by its barred, rather than wholly black, tail and a lack of white wing bars. The most similar species is the Asiatic dowitcher.<br/><br/>There are three subspecies, listed from west to east:<ul><li><em>L. l. lapponica</em> - <small>(Linnaeus, 1758)</small>: Breeds from northern Scandinavia east to the Taymyr Peninsula; winters western coasts of Europe and Africa from the British Isles and the Netherlands south to South Africa, and also around the Persian Gulf.

			"Description": "The <strong>black-tailed godwit</strong> (<em>Limosa limosa</em>) is a large, long-legged, long-billed shorebird first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. It is a member of the <em>Limosa</em> genus, the godwits. There are three subspecies, all with orange head, neck and chest in breeding plumage and dull grey-brown winter coloration, and distinctive black and white wingbar at all times.<br/><br/>Its breeding range stretches from Iceland through Europe and areas of central Asia. Black-tailed godwits spend (the northern hemisphere) winter in areas as diverse as the Indian Subcontinent, Australia, western Europe and west Africa. The species breeds in fens, lake edges, damp meadows, moorlands and bogs and uses estuaries, swamps and floods in (the northern hemisphere) winter; it is more likely to be found inland and on freshwater than the similar bar-tailed godwit. The world population is estimated to be 634,000 to 805,000 birds and is classified as Near Threatened.<br/><br/>The black-tailed godwit is a large wader with long bill (7.5 to 12&nbsp;cm (3.0 to 4.7&nbsp;in) long), neck and legs. During the breeding season, the bill has a yellowish or orange-pink base and dark tip; the base is pink in winter. The legs are dark grey, brown or black. The sexes are similar, but in breeding plumage, they can be separated by the male's brighter, more extensive orange breast, neck and head. In winter, adult black-tailed godwits have a uniform brown-grey breast and upperparts (in contrast to the bar-tailed godwit's streaked back). Juveniles have a pale orange wash to the neck and breast.<br/><br/>In flight, its bold black and white wingbar and white rump can be seen readily. When on the ground it can be difficult to separate from the similar Bar-tailed Godwit, but the black-tailed godwit's longer, straighter bill and longer legs are diagnostic. Black-tailed godwits are similar in body size and shape to bar-taileds, but stand taller.<br/><br/>It measures 42&nbsp;cm (17&nbsp;in) from bill to tail with a wingspan of 70&ndash;82&nbsp;cm (28&ndash;32&nbsp;in). Males weigh around 280&nbsp;g (9.9&nbsp;oz) and females 340&nbsp;g (12&nbsp;oz). The female is around 5% larger than the male, with a bill 12&ndash;15% longer.<br/><br/>The most common call is a strident <em>weeka weeka weeka</em>.<br/><br/>A study of black-tailed godwits in the Netherlands found a mortality rate of 37.6% in the first year of life, 32% in the second year, and 36.9% thereafter.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)<br/><br/>The online Windows XP simulator runs in a web browser and its operation imitates the operating system.

			"species": "interpres",
			"Description": "The <strong>ruddy turnstone</strong> (<em>Arenaria interpres</em>) is a small wading bird, one of two species of turnstone in the genus <em>Arenaria</em>. The scientific name is from Latin. The genus name <em>arenaria</em> derives from <em>arenarius</em>, \"inhabiting sand, from <em>arena</em>, \"sand\". The specific <em>interpres</em> means \"messenger\"; when visiting Gotland in 1741, Linnaeus thought that the Swedish word <em>Tolk</em> \"interpreter\" applied to this species, but in the local dialect the word means \"legs\" and is used for the redshank.<br/><br/>It is now classified in the sandpiper family Scolopacidae but was formerly sometimes placed in the plover family Charadriidae. It is a highly migratory bird, breeding in northern parts of Eurasia and North America and flying south to winter on coastlines almost worldwide. It is the only species of turnstone in much of its range and is often known simply as <strong>turnstone</strong>.<br/><br/>It is a fairly small and stocky bird, 22&ndash;24&nbsp;cm (8.7&ndash;9.4&nbsp;in) long with a wingspan of 50&ndash;57&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;22&nbsp;in) and a weight of 85&ndash;150&nbsp;g (3.0&ndash;5.3&nbsp;oz). The dark, wedge-shaped bill is 2&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (0.79&ndash;0.98&nbsp;in) long and slightly upturned. The legs are fairly short at 3.5&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in) and are bright orange.<br/><br/>In all seasons, the plumage is dominated by a harlequin-like pattern of black and white. Breeding birds have reddish-brown upper parts with black markings. The head is mainly white with black streaks on the crown and a black pattern on the face. The breast is mainly black apart from a white patch on the sides. The rest of the underparts are white. In flight it reveals a white wingbar, white patch near the base of the wing and white lower back, rump and tail with dark bands on the uppertail-coverts and near the tip of the tail. The female is slightly duller than the male and has a browner head with more streaking.<br/><br/>Non-breeding adults are duller than breeding birds and have dark grey-brown upperparts with black mottling and a dark head with little white. Juvenile birds have a pale brown head and pale fringes to the upperpart feathers creating a scaly impression.<br/><br/>Birds of the subspecies <em>morinella</em> are smaller with darker upperparts and less streaking on the crown.<br/><br/>The ruddy turnstone has a staccato, rattling call and also a chattering alarm-call which is mainly given during the breeding season.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Calidris",
			"species": "canutus",
			"Description": "The <strong>red knot</strong> (<em>Calidris canutus</em>) (just <strong>knot</strong> in English-speaking Europe) is a medium-sized shorebird which breeds in tundra and the Arctic Cordillera in the far north of Canada, Europe, and Russia. It is a large member of the <em>Calidris</em> sandpipers, second only to the great knot. Six subspecies are recognised.<br/><br/>Their diet varies according to season; arthropods and larvae are the preferred food items at the breeding grounds, while various hard-shelled molluscs are consumed at other feeding sites at other times. North American breeders migrate to coastal areas in Europe and South America, while the Eurasian populations winter in Africa, Papua New Guinea, Australia, and New Zealand. This species forms enormous flocks when not breeding.<br/><br/>An adult red knot is the second largest <em>Calidris</em> sandpiper, measuring 23&ndash;26&nbsp;cm (9.1&ndash;10.2&nbsp;in) long with a 47&ndash;53&nbsp;cm (19&ndash;21&nbsp;in) wingspan. The body shape is typical for the genus, with a small head and eyes, a short neck and a slightly tapering bill that is no longer than its head. It has short dark legs and a medium thin dark bill. The winter, or basic, plumage becomes uniformly pale grey, and is similar between the sexes. The alternate, or breeding, plumage is mottled grey on top with a cinnamon face, throat and breast and light-coloured rear belly. The alternate plumage of females is similar to that of the male except it is slightly lighter and the eye-line is less distinct. <em>Canutus, islandica</em> and <em>piersmai</em> are the \"darker\" subspecies. Subspecies <em>rogersi</em> has a lighter belly than either <em>roselaari</em> or <em>piersmai</em>, and <em>rufa</em> is the lightest in overall plumage. The transition from alternate to basic plumages begins at the breeding site but is most pronounced during the southwards migration. The molt to alternate plumage begins just prior to the northwards migration to the breeding grounds, but is mostly during the migration period.<br/><br/>The large size, white wing bar and grey rump and tail make it easy to identify in flight. When feeding the short dark green legs give it a characteristic 'low-slung' appearance. When foraging singly, they rarely call, but when flying in a flock they make a low monosyllabic <em>knutt</em> and when migrating they utter a disyllabic <em>knuup-knuup</em>. They breed in the moist tundra during June to August. The display song of the male is a fluty <em>poor-me</em>. The display includes circling high with quivering wing beats and tumbling to the ground with the wings held upward. Both sexes incubate the eggs, but the female leaves parental care to the male once the eggs have hatched.<br/><br/>Juvenile birds have distinctive submarginal lines and brown coverts during the first year. In the breeding season the males can be separated with difficulty (&lt;80% accuracy in comparison to molecular methods) based on the more even shade of the red underparts that extend towards the rear of the belly.<br/><br/>The weight varies with subspecies, but ranges between 100 and 200&nbsp;g (3.5 and 7.1&nbsp;oz). Red knots can double their weight prior to migration. Like many migratory birds they also reduce the size of their digestive organs prior to migration. The extent of the atrophy is not as pronounced as species like the bar-tailed godwit, probably because there are more opportunities to feed during migration for the red knot. Red knots are also able to change the size of their digestive organs seasonally. The size of the gizzard increases in thickness when feeding on harder foods on the wintering ground and decreases in size while feeding on softer foods in the breeding grounds. These changes can be very rapid, occurring in as little as six days.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Calidris",
			"species": "pugnax",
			"Description": "The <strong>ruff</strong> (<em>Calidris pugnax</em>) is a medium-sized wading bird that breeds in marshes and wet meadows across northern Eurasia. This highly gregarious sandpiper is migratory and sometimes forms huge flocks in its winter grounds, which include southern and western Europe, Africa, southern Asia and Australia.<br/><br/>The ruff is a long-necked, pot-bellied bird. This species shows marked sexual dimorphism; the male is much larger than the female (the reeve), and has a breeding plumage that includes brightly coloured head tufts, bare orange facial skin, extensive black on the breast, and the large collar of ornamental feathers that inspired this bird's English name. The female and the non-breeding male have grey-brown upperparts and mainly white underparts. Three differently plumaged types of male, including a rare form that mimics the female, use a variety of strategies to obtain mating opportunities at a lek, and the colourful head and neck feathers are erected as part of the elaborate main courting display. The female has one brood per year and lays four eggs in a well-hidden ground nest, incubating the eggs and rearing the chicks, which are mobile soon after hatching, on her own. Predators of wader chicks and eggs include mammals such as foxes, feral cats and stoats, and birds such as large gulls, corvids and skuas.<br/><br/>The ruff forages in wet grassland and soft mud, probing or searching by sight for edible items. It primarily feeds on insects, especially in the breeding season, but it will consume plant material, including rice and maize, on migration and in winter. Classified as \"least concern\" on the IUCN Red List criteria, the global conservation concerns are relatively low because of the large numbers that breed in Scandinavia and the Arctic. However, the range in much of Europe is contracting because of land drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of mown or grazed breeding sites, and over-hunting. This decline has seen it listed in the <em>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</em> (AEWA).<br/><br/>The ruff has a distinctive gravy boat appearance, with a small head, medium-length bill, longish neck and pot-bellied body. It has long legs that are variable in colour but usually yellow or orange. In flight, it has a deeper, slower wing stroke than other waders of a similar size, and displays a thin, indistinct white bar on the wing, and white ovals on the sides of the tail. This species shows sexual dimorphism. Although a small percentage of males resemble females, the typical male is much larger than the female and has an elaborate breeding plumage. He is 29&ndash;32&nbsp;cm (11&ndash;13&nbsp;in) long with a 54&ndash;60&nbsp;cm (21&ndash;24&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighs about 180&nbsp;g (6.3&nbsp;oz). In the May-to-June breeding season, the typical male's legs, bill and warty bare facial skin are orange, and he has distinctive head tufts and a neck ruff. These ornaments vary on individual birds, being black, chestnut or white, with the colouring solid, barred or irregular. The grey-brown back has a scale-like pattern, often with black or chestnut feathers, and the underparts are white with extensive black on the breast. The extreme variability of the main breeding plumage is thought to have developed to aid individual recognition in a species that has communal breeding displays, but is usually mute.<br/><br/>Outside the breeding season, the typical male's head and neck decorations and the bare facial skin are lost and the legs and bill become duller. The upperparts are grey-brown, and the underparts are white with grey mottling on the breast and flanks.<br/><br/>The female, or \"reeve\", is 22&ndash;26&nbsp;cm (8.7&ndash;10.2&nbsp;in) long with a 46&ndash;49&nbsp;cm (18&ndash;19&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighs about 110&nbsp;g (3.9&nbsp;oz). In breeding plumage, she has grey-brown upperparts with white-fringed, dark-centred feathers. The breast and flanks are variably blotched with black. In winter, her plumage is similar to that of the male, but the sexes are distinguishable on size. The plumage of the juvenile ruff resembles the non-breeding adult, but has upperparts with a neat, scale-like pattern with dark feather centres, and a strong buff tinge to the underparts.<br/><br/>Typical adult male ruffs start to moult into the main display plumage before their return to the breeding areas, and the proportion of birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.<br/><br/>Ruffs of both sexes have an additional moult stage between the winter and final summer plumages, a phenomenon also seen in the bar-tailed godwit. Before developing the full display finery with coloured ruff and tufts, the males replace part of their winter plumage with striped feathers. Females also develop a mix of winter and striped feathers before reaching their summer appearance. The final male breeding plumage results from the replacement of both winter and striped feathers, but the female retains the striped feathers and replaces only the winter feathers to reach her summer plumage. The striped prenuptial plumages may represent the original breeding appearance of this species, the male's showy nuptial feathers evolving later under strong sexual selection pressures.<br/><br/>Adult males and most adult females start their pre-winter moult before returning south, but complete most feather replacement on the wintering grounds. In Kenya, males moult 3&ndash;4 weeks ahead of the females, finishing before December, whereas females typically complete feather replacement during December and early January. Juveniles moult from their first summer body plumage into winter plumage during late September to November, and later undergo a pre-breeding moult similar in timing and duration to that of the adults, and often producing as brightly coloured an appearance.<br/><br/>Two other waders can be confused with the ruff. The juvenile sharp-tailed sandpiper is a little smaller than a juvenile female ruff and has a similar rich orange-buff breast, but the ruff is slimmer with a longer neck and legs, a rounder head, and a much plainer face. The buff-breasted sandpiper also resembles a small juvenile ruff, but even the female ruff is noticeably larger than the sandpiper, with a longer bill, more rotund body and scaly-patterned upperparts.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>sanderling</strong> (<em>Calidris alba</em>) is a small wading bird. The name derives from Old English <em>sand-yr&eth;ling</em>, \"sand-ploughman\". The genus name is from Ancient Greek <em>kalidris</em> or <em>skalidris</em>, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific <em>alba</em> is Latin for \"white\".<br/><br/>It is a circumpolar Arctic breeder, and is a long-distance migrant, wintering south to South America, South Europe, Africa, and Australia. It is highly gregarious in winter, sometimes forming large flocks on coastal mudflats or sandy beaches.<br/><br/>It is somewhat unlike other sandpipers in appearance, which has led to the suggestion that it should be placed into a monotypic genus <em>Crocethia</em>. A more recent review (Thomas <em>et al.</em>, 2004) indicates, however, that the sanderling is a fairly typical \"stint\" or small sandpiper and should be separated from the large knots with its closest relatives in a distinct genus.<br/><br/>This bird is similar in size to a dunlin, but stouter, with a thick bill. It shows a strong white wingbar in flight, and runs along the sandy beaches it prefers with a characteristic \"bicycling\" action of its legs, stopping frequently to pick small food items. It eats small crabs and other small invertebrates. In spring, birds migrating north from South America consume large numbers of horseshoe crab eggs in the Delaware Bay area.<br/><br/>In spring, the birds arrive on the High Arctic breeding grounds (see map), where they lay 3&ndash;4 eggs in a ground scrape. On the nesting grounds, these birds mainly eat insects and some plant material.<br/><br/>The sanderling was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name <em>Trynga alba</em>.<br/><br/>The sanderling is one of the species to which the <em>Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds</em> (AEWA) applies.<br/><br/>The sanderling is a small plump sandpiper, 18&ndash;20&nbsp;cm (7.1&ndash;7.9&nbsp;in) in length. Its weight ranges from 40&ndash;100&nbsp;g (1.4&ndash;3.5&nbsp;oz). The winter bird is very pale, almost white apart from a dark shoulder patch. This is the source of the specific name, <em>alba</em>, which is the Latin for \"white\". Later in the summer, the face and throat become brick-red. The juvenile bird is spangled black and white, and shows much more contrast than the adult.<br/><br/>If its size is misjudged, a sanderling in breeding plumage can be mistaken for some varieties of stint, or a sanderling in winter plumage can be mistaken for a dunlin or red knot. It can be told from other small wading birds, given good views, by its lack of a hind toe. Its behavior is also distinctive.<br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

The genus name is from Ancient Greek <em>kalidris</em> or <em>skalidris</em>, a term used by Aristotle for some grey-coloured waterside birds. The specific <em>alpina</em> is from Latin and means \"of high mountains\", in this case referring to the Alps.<br/><br/>It is a circumpolar breeder in Arctic or subarctic regions. Birds that breed in northern Europe and Asia are long-distance migrants, wintering south to Africa, southeast Asia and the Middle East. Birds that breed in Alaska and the Canadian Arctic migrate short distances to the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, although those nesting in northern Alaska overwinter in Asia. Many dunlins winter along the Iberian south coast.<br/><br/>An adult dunlin in breeding plumage shows the distinctive black belly which no other similar-sized wader possesses. The winter dunlin is basically grey above and white below. Juveniles are brown above with two whitish \"V\" shapes on the back. They usually have black marks on the flanks or belly and show a strong white wingbar in flight.<br/><br/>The legs and slightly decurved bill are black. There are a number of subspecies differing mainly in the extent of rufous colouration in the breeding plumage and the bill length. Bill length varies between sexes, the females having longer bills than the males.<br/><br/>Ref: Wikipedia",

When threatened, the female can carry chicks between her legs, in her claws or on her back while flying, though this is rarely witnessed. The world population is estimated to be 14 million to 16 million birds.<br/><br/>Adults are 33&ndash;38&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;15&nbsp;in) in length, including the 6&ndash;8&nbsp;cm (2.4&ndash;3.1&nbsp;in) long straight bill, and have a 55&ndash;65&nbsp;cm (22&ndash;26&nbsp;in) wingspan.

The specific <em>ochropus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>okhros</em>, \"ochre\", and <em>pous</em>, \"foot\".<br/><br/>The green sandpiper represents an ancient lineage of the genus <em>Tringa</em>; its only close living relative is the solitary sandpiper (<em>T. solitaria</em>). They both have brown wings with little light dots and a delicate but contrasting neck and chest pattern. In addition, both species nest in trees, unlike most other scolopacids.<br/><br/>Given its basal position in <em>Tringa</em>, it is fairly unsurprising that suspected cases of hybridisation between this species and the common sandpiper (<em>A. hypoleucos</em>) of the sister genus <em>Actitis</em> have been reported.<br/><br/>This species is a somewhat plump wader with a dark greenish-brown back and wings, greyish head and breast and otherwise white underparts. The back is spotted white to varying extents, being maximal in the breeding adult, and less in winter and young birds. The legs and short bill are both dark green.<br/><br/>It is conspicuous and characteristically patterned in flight, with the wings dark above and below and a brilliant white rump.

The genus name <em>Tringa</em> is the New Latin name given to the green sandpiper by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek <em>trungas</em>, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific <em>erythropus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>eruthros</em>, \"red\", and <em>pous</em>, \"foot\".<br/><br/>It breeds across northern Scandinavia and northern Asia and migrates south to the Mediterranean, the southern British Isles, France, tropical Africa, and tropical Asia for the winter. It is an occasional vagrant to Australia and North America.<br/><br/>This is a large wader (shorebird), measuring 29&ndash;31&nbsp;cm (11&ndash;12&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 61&ndash;67&nbsp;cm (24&ndash;26&nbsp;in) and a weight ranging from 121 to 205&nbsp;g (4.3 to 7.2&nbsp;oz). It is black in breeding plumage, and very pale in winter. It has a red legs and bill, and shows a white oval on the back in flight. Juveniles are grey-brown finely speckled white above, and have pale, finely barred underparts. Adults moult completely between July and October. In spring, the body plumage is moulted between March and May. Juveniles have a partial moult between August and February. The call is a creaking whistle <em>teu-it</em> (somewhat similar to the call of a roseate tern), the alarm call a <em>kyip-kyip-kyip</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Atlantic puffin</strong> (<em>Fratercula arctica</em>), also known as the <strong>common puffin</strong>, is a species of seabird in the auk family. It is the only puffin native to the Atlantic Ocean; two related species, the tufted puffin and the horned puffin, are found in the northeastern Pacific. The Atlantic puffin breeds in Iceland, Norway, Greenland, Newfoundland and many North Atlantic islands, and as far south as Maine in the west and the British Isles in the east. Although it has a large population and a wide range, the species has declined rapidly, at least in parts of its range, resulting in it being rated as vulnerable by the IUCN. On land, it has the typical upright stance of an auk. At sea, it swims on the surface and feeds mainly on small fish, which it catches by diving underwater, using its wings for propulsion.<br/><br/>This puffin has a black crown and back, pale grey cheek patches and white underparts. Its broad, boldly marked red and black beak and orange legs contrast with its plumage. It moults while at sea in the winter and some of the bright-coloured facial characteristics are lost. The external appearance of the adult male and female are identical except that the male is usually slightly larger. The juvenile has similar plumage but its cheek patches are dark grey. The juvenile does not have brightly coloured head ornamentation, its bill is less broad and is dark-grey with a yellowish-brown tip, and its legs and feet are also dark. Puffins from northern populations are typically larger than their counterparts in southern parts of the range. It is generally considered that these populations are different subspecies.<br/><br/>Spending the autumn and winter in the open ocean of the cold northern seas, the Atlantic puffin returns to coastal areas at the start of the breeding season in late spring. It nests in clifftop colonies, digging a burrow in which a single white egg is laid. The chick mostly feeds on whole fish and grows rapidly. After about six weeks it is fully fledged and makes its way at night to the sea. It swims away from the shore and does not return to land for several years.<br/><br/>Colonies are mostly on islands where there are no terrestrial predators but adult birds and newly fledged chicks are at risk of attacks from the air by gulls and skuas. Sometimes a bird such as an Arctic skua will harass a puffin arriving with a beakful of fish, causing it to drop its catch. The striking appearance, large colourful bill, waddling gait and behaviour of this bird have given rise to nicknames such as \"clown of the sea\" and \"sea parrot\". It is the official bird symbol for the Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador.<br/><br/>The Atlantic puffin is sturdily built with a thick-set neck and short wings and tail. It is 28 to 30 centimetres (11 to 12&nbsp;in) in length from the tip of its stout bill to its blunt-ended tail. Its wingspan is 47 to 63 centimetres (19 to 25&nbsp;in) and on land it stands about 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) high. The male is generally slightly larger than the female, but they are coloured alike. The forehead, crown and nape are glossy black, as are the back, wings and tail. A broad black collar extends around the neck and throat. On each side of the head is a large, lozenge-shaped area of very pale grey. These face patches taper to a point and nearly meet at the back of the neck. The shape of the head creates a crease extending from the eye to the hindmost point of each patch giving the appearance of a grey streak. The eye looks almost triangular in shape because of a small, peaked area of horny blue-grey skin above it and a rectangular patch below. The irises are brown or very dark blue and each has red orbital ring. The underparts of the bird, the breast, belly and undertail coverts, are white. By the end of the breeding season, the black plumage may have lost its shine or even taken on a slightly brownish tinge. The legs are short and set well back on the body giving the bird its upright stance on land. Both legs and large webbed feet are bright orange, contrasting with the sharp black claws.<br/><br/>The beak is very distinctive. From the side the beak is broad and triangular but viewed from above it is narrow. The half nearest the tip is orange-red and the half nearest to the head is slate grey. There is a yellow chevron-shaped ridge separating the two parts and a yellow, fleshy strip at the base of the bill. At the joint of the two mandibles there is a yellow, wrinkled rosette. The exact proportions of the beak vary with the age of the bird. In an immature individual, the beak has reached its full length but it is not as broad as that of an adult. With time the bill deepens, the upper edge curves and a kink develops at its base. As the bird ages, one or more grooves may form on the red portion. The bird has a powerful bite.<br/><br/>The characteristic bright orange bill plates and other facial characteristics develop in the spring. At the close of the breeding season, these special coatings and appendages are shed in a partial moult. This makes the beak appear less broad, the tip less bright and the base darker grey. The eye ornaments are shed and the eyes appear round. At the same time, the feathers of the head and neck are replaced and the face becomes darker. This winter plumage is seldom seen by humans because when they have left their chicks, the birds head out to sea and do not return to land until the next breeding season. The juvenile bird is similar to the adult in plumage but altogether duller with a much darker grey face and yellowish-brown beak tip and legs. After fledging, it will make its way to the water and will head out to sea and not return to land for several years. In the interim, each year it will have a broader bill, paler face patches and brighter legs and beak.<br/><br/>The Atlantic puffin has a direct flight, typically 10 metres (33&nbsp;ft) above the sea surface and higher over the water than most other auks. It mostly moves by paddling along efficiently with its webbed feet and seldom takes to the air. It is typically silent at sea, except for the soft purring sounds it sometimes makes in flight. At the breeding colony it is quiet above ground but in its burrow makes a growling sound somewhat resembling a chainsaw being revved up.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>razorbill</strong> (<em>Alca torda</em>) is a colonial seabird that comes to land only to breed. This agile bird chooses one partner for life; females lay one egg per year. Razorbills nest along coastal cliffs in enclosed or slightly exposed crevices. The parents spend equal amounts of time incubating. Once the chick has hatched, the parents take turns foraging for their young and sometimes fly long distances before finding prey.<br/><br/>The razorbill is primarily black with a white underside. The male and female are identical in plumage; however, males are generally larger than females. In 1918, the razorbill was protected in the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Presently, the major threat for the population is the destruction of breeding sites.<br/><br/>The razorbill has white underparts and a black head, neck, back and feet during breeding season. A thin white line also extends from the eyes to the end of the bill. Its head is darker than that of a common murre. During the nonbreeding season, the throat and face behind the eye become white, and the white line on the face becomes less prominent. The thick black bill has a blunt end. It is large for an alcid and its mean weight ranges from 505 to 890&nbsp;g (17.8 to 31.4&nbsp;oz). The female and male adults are very much alike, having only small differences such as wing length. The wing length of adult males ranges from 201&ndash;216&nbsp;mm (7.9&ndash;8.5&nbsp;in) while that of females ranges from 201 to 213&nbsp;mm (7.9 to 8.4&nbsp;in). This species has a horizontal stance and the tail feathers are slightly longer in the center in comparison to other alcids. This makes the razorbill have a distinctly long tail which is not common for an auk. Their mating system is female-enforced monogamy; the razorbill chooses one partner for life. It nests in open or hidden crevices among cliffs and boulders. It is a colonial breeder and only comes to land to breed. The annual survival rate of the razorbill is between 89-95%. Though the razorbill's average lifespan is roughly 13 years, a bird ringed in the UK in 1967 has survived for at least 41 years &mdash; a record for the species.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>great skua</strong> (<em>Stercorarius skua</em>) is a large seabird in the skua family Stercorariidae. The English name and species name \"skua\" is believed to originate from the Faroese <em>sk&uacute;vur</em> or <em>sk&uacute;gvur</em> [?sk?kv??r] and is the only known bird name to originate from the Faroes that has come into regular use elsewhere. In Britain, it is sometimes known by the name <strong>bonxie</strong>, a Shetland name of Norse origin. The genus name <em>Stercorarius</em> is Latin and means \"of dung\"; the food disgorged by other birds when pursued by skuas was once thought to be excrement.<br/><br/>Great skuas measure 50&ndash;58&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;23&nbsp;in) long and have a 125&ndash;140&nbsp;cm (49&ndash;55&nbsp;in) wingspan. One study found that 112 males weighed an average of 1.27&nbsp;kg (2.8&nbsp;lb) and that 125 females weighed an average of 1.41&nbsp;kg (3.1&nbsp;lb). Adults are a streaked greyish brown, with a black cap, while juveniles are a warmer brown and unstreaked below. They have a short, blunt tail, and a powerful flight. The great skua's call is a harsh <em>hah-hah-hah-hah</em>; quacking and croaking noises have also been heard. Distinguishing this skua from the other North Atlantic skuas (parasitic jaeger, pomarine jaeger and long-tailed jaeger) is relatively straightforward. The herring gull size, massive barrel chest and white wing flashes of this bird are distinctive even at a distance. It is sometimes said to give the impression of a common buzzard. Identification of this skua is only complicated when it is necessary to distinguish it from the closely related large southern-hemisphere skuas. Despite its name, the great skua is marginally smaller on average than the other 3 large southern-hemisphere skuas, although not by enough to distinguish them by size in the field. Some authorities still regard the great skua as conspecific with some of these southern skuas, and as a group they have sometimes been separated in the genus <em>Catharacta</em>, although currently this taxonomy is not commonly followed.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>black-legged kittiwake</strong> (<em>Rissa tridactyla</em>) is a seabird species in the gull family Laridae.<br/><br/>This species was first described by Linnaeus in his <em>Systema naturae</em> in 1758 as <em>Larus tridactylus</em>. The English name is derived from its call, a shrill 'kittee-wa-aaake, kitte-wa-aaake'. The genus name <em>Rissa</em> is from the Icelandic name <em>Rita</em> for this bird, and the specific <em>tridactyla</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>tridaktulos</em>, \"three-toed\", from <em>tri-</em>, \"three-\" and <em>daktulos</em>, \"toe\".<br/><br/>In North America, this species is known as the black-legged kittiwake to differentiate it from the red-legged kittiwake, but in Europe, where it is the only member of the genus, it is often known just as <strong>kittiwake</strong>.<br/><br/>The adult is 37&ndash;41&nbsp;cm (15&ndash;16&nbsp;in) in length with a wingspan of 91&ndash;105&nbsp;cm (36&ndash;41&nbsp;in) and a body mass of 305&ndash;525&nbsp;g (10.8&ndash;18.5&nbsp;oz). It has a white head and body, grey back, grey wings tipped solid black, black legs and a yellow bill. Occasional individuals have pinky-grey to reddish legs, inviting confusion with red-legged kittiwake. In winter, this species acquires a dark grey smudge behind the eye and a grey hind-neck collar.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>slender-billed gull</strong> (<em>Chroicocephalus genei</em>) is a mid-sized gull which breeds very locally around the Mediterranean and the north of the western Indian Ocean (e.g. Pakistan) on islands and coastal lagoons. Most of the population is somewhat migratory, wintering further south to north Africa and India, and a few birds have wandered to western Europe. A stray individual was reportedly seen on Antigua, April 24, 1976 (AOU, 2000).<br/><br/>The genus name <em>Chroicocephalus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>khroizo</em>, \"to colour\", and <em>kephale</em>, \"head\".

It is therefore slightly larger than the black-headed gull, which it resembles, although it does not have a black hood in summer. It has a pale grey body, white head and breast and black tips to the primary wing feathers. The head and dark red bill have an elongated tapering appearance, and this bird also appears long-necked. The legs are dark red, and the iris is yellow. In summer, the breast has a faint pink colouration. This bird takes two years to reach maturity, as is usual in gulls. First year immature birds have a black terminal tail band, and dark areas on the wings.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>black-headed gull</strong> (<em>Chroicocephalus ridibundus</em>) is a small gull that breeds in much of Europe and Asia, and also in coastal eastern Canada. Most of the population is migratory and winters further south, but some birds reside in the milder westernmost areas of Europe. Some black-headed gulls also spend the winter in northeastern North America, where it was formerly known as the common black-headed gull. As is the case with many gulls, it was previously placed in the genus <em>Larus</em>.<br/><br/>The genus name <em>Chroicocephalus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>khroizo</em>, \"to colour\", and <em>kephale</em>, \"head\". The specific <em>ridibundus</em> is Latin for \"laughing\", from <em>ridere</em> \"to laugh\".<br/><br/>This gull is 38&ndash;44&nbsp;cm (15&ndash;17&nbsp;in) long with a 94&ndash;105&nbsp;cm (37&ndash;41&nbsp;in) wingspan. In flight, the white leading edge to the wing is a good field mark. The summer adult has a chocolate-brown head (not black, although does look black from a distance), pale grey body, black tips to the primary wing feathers, and red bill and legs. The hood is lost in winter, leaving just 2 dark spots. Immature birds have a mottled pattern of brown spots over most of the body. It breeds in colonies in large reed beds or marshes, or on islands in lakes, nesting on the ground. Like most gulls, it is highly gregarious in winter, both when feeding or in evening roosts. It is not a pelagic species and is rarely seen at sea far from coasts.<br/><br/>The black-headed gull is a bold and opportunistic feeder. It eats insects, fish, seeds, worms, scraps, and carrion in towns, or invertebrates in ploughed fields with equal relish. It is a noisy species, especially in colonies, with a familiar \"kree-ar\" call. Its scientific name means <em>laughing gull</em>.<br/><br/>This species takes two years to reach maturity. First-year birds have a black terminal tail band, more dark areas in the wings, and, in summer, a less fully developed dark hood. Like most gulls, black-headed gulls are long-lived birds, with a maximum age of at least 32.9 years recorded in the wild, in addition to an anecdote now believed of dubious authenticity regarding a 63-year-old bird.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The genus name <em>Hydrocoloeus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>hudro</em>, \"water\", and <em>koloios</em>, a sort of web-footed bird. The specific <em>minutus</em> is Latin for \"small\".<br/><br/>It also has small colonies in parts of southern Canada. It is migratory, wintering on coasts in western Europe, the Mediterranean and (in small numbers) the northeast United States; in recent years non-breeding birds have summered in western Europe in increasing numbers and in 2016 they successfully nested for the first time in Great Britain at the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds reserve at Loch of Strathbeg reserve in Aberdeenshire. As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus <em>Larus</em>. It is the only member of the genus <em><strong>Hydrocoloeus</strong></em>, although it has been suggested that Ross's gull also should be included in this genus.<br/><br/>This species breeds colonially on freshwater marshes, making a lined nest on the ground amongst vegetation. Normally 2&ndash;6 eggs are laid.<br/><br/>This is the smallest gull species, with a length of 25&ndash;30&nbsp;cm (9.8&ndash;11.8&nbsp;in), a wingspan of 61&ndash;78&nbsp;cm (24&ndash;31&nbsp;in), and a mass of 68&ndash;162&nbsp;g (2.4&ndash;5.7&nbsp;oz). It is pale grey in breeding plumage with a black hood, dark underwings and often a pinkish flush on the breast. In winter, the head goes white apart from a darker cap and eye-spot. The bill is thin and black and the legs dark red. The flight on rounded wings is somewhat tern-like.<br/><br/>Young birds have black markings on the head and upperparts, and \"W\" pattern across the wings. They take three years to reach maturity.<br/><br/>These gulls pick food off the water surface, and will also catch insects in the air like a black tern.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The breeding plumage adult is a distinctive white gull, with a very pale grey mantle and wings with white primary feathers without black tips. The black hood extends down the nape and shows distinct white eye crescents. The blunt tipped, parallel sided, dark red bill has a black subterminal band. The non breeding adult is similar but the hood is reduced to an extensive dusky \"bandit\" mask through the eye. This bird takes two years to reach maturity.

As is the case with many gulls, it has traditionally been placed in the genus <em>Larus</em>.<br/><br/>In the late 1960s, this was one of the world's rarest gulls, with a population of only 1,000 pairs. It has established new colonies, but remains rare with a population of about 10,000 pairs.<br/><br/>This species, unlike many large gulls, rarely scavenges, but is a specialist fish eater, and is therefore strictly coastal and pelagic. This bird will feed at night, often well out to sea, but also slowly patrols close into beaches, occasionally dangling its legs to increase drag.<br/><br/>The adult basically resembles a small European herring gull, the most noticeable differences being the short stubby red bill and \"string of pearls\" white wing primary tips, rather than the large \"mirrors\" of some other species. The legs are grey-green. It takes four years to reach adult plumage.<br/><br/>This species shows little tendency to wander from its breeding areas, but there were single records in the Netherlands and England in May 2003.<br/><br/>The Audouin's gull is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The scientific name is from Latin. <em>Larus</em> appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and <em>fuscus</em> meant black or brown.<br/><br/>It is migratory, wintering from the British Isles south to West Africa. It is a regular winter visitor to the east coast of North America, probably from the breeding population in Iceland.<br/><br/>They are smaller than the herring gull. The taxonomy of the herring gull / lesser black-backed gull complex is very complicated; different authorities recognise between two and eight species. This group has a ring distribution around the northern hemisphere. Differences between adjacent forms in this ring are fairly small, but by the time the circuit is completed, the end members, herring gull and lesser black-backed gull, are clearly different species. The lesser black-backed gull measures 51&ndash;64&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;25&nbsp;in), 124&ndash;150&nbsp;cm (49&ndash;59&nbsp;in) across the wings and weighs 452&ndash;1,100&nbsp;g (0.996&ndash;2.425&nbsp;lb), with the nominate race averaging slightly smaller than the other two subspecies. Males, at average weight of 824&nbsp;g (1.817&nbsp;lb), are slightly larger than females, at an average of 708&nbsp;g (1.561&nbsp;lb). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 38.3 to 45&nbsp;cm (15.1 to 17.7&nbsp;in), the bill is 4.2 to 5.8&nbsp;cm (1.7 to 2.3&nbsp;in) and the tarsus is 5.2 to 6.9&nbsp;cm (2.0 to 2.7&nbsp;in). A confusable species is the great black-backed gull. The lesser is a much smaller bird, with slimmer build, yellow rather than pinkish legs, and smaller white \"mirrors\" at the wing tips. The adults have black or dark grey wings (depending on race) and back. The bill is yellow with a red spot which young peck at, inducing feeding (see fixed action pattern). The head is greyer in winter, unlike great black-backed. Annual moult for adults begins between May and August and is not complete on some birds until November. Partial pre-breeding moult between January and April.<br/><br/>Young birds have scaly black-brown upperparts and a neat wing pattern. They take four years to reach maturity. Identification from juvenile herring gulls is most readily done by the more solidly dark (unbarred) tertial feathers.<br/><br/>The call is a \"laughing\" cry like that of the herring gull (to which this species is closely related), but with a markedly deeper pitch.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It was formerly treated as a subspecies of either the Caspian gull <em>L. cachinnans</em>, or more broadly as a subspecies of the herring gull <em>L. argentatus</em>. The genus name is from Latin <em>Larus</em> which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird, and the species name honours the German zoologist Karl Michahelles.<br/><br/>The yellow-legged gull is a large gull, though the size does vary, with the smallest females being scarcely larger than a common gull and the largest males being roughly the size of a great black-backed gull. They range in length from 52 to 68&nbsp;cm (20 to 27&nbsp;in) in total length, from 120 to 155&nbsp;cm (47 to 61&nbsp;in) in wingspan and from 550 to 1,600&nbsp;g (1.21 to 3.53&nbsp;lb) in weight. Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 40.8 to 47.2&nbsp;cm (16.1 to 18.6&nbsp;in), the bill is 4.6 to 6&nbsp;cm (1.8 to 2.4&nbsp;in) and the tarsus is 5.6 to 7.5&nbsp;cm (2.2 to 3.0&nbsp;in). Adults are externally similar to herring gulls but have yellow legs. They have a grey back, slightly darker than herring gulls but lighter than lesser black-backed gulls. They are much whiter-headed in autumn, and have more extensively black wing tips with few white spots, just as lesser black-backed. They have a red spot on the bill as adults, like the entire complex. There is a red ring around the eye like in the lesser black-backed gull but unlike in the herring gull which has a dark yellow ring.<br/><br/>First-year birds have a paler head, rump and underparts than those of the herring gull, more closely resembling first-year great black-backed gulls in plumage. They have a dark bill and eyes, pinkish grey legs, dark flight feathers and a well-defined black band on the tail. They become lighter in the underparts and lose the upperpart pattern subsequently. By their second winter, birds are essentially feathered like adults, save for the patterned feathers remaining on the wing coverts. However, their bill tips are black, their eyes still dark, and the legs are a light yellow flesh colour.<br/><br/>The call is a loud laugh which is deeper and more nasal than the call of the herring gull.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It was formerly placed into the genus <em>Sterna</em>, which now is restricted to the large white terns. The genus name is a diminutive of <em>Sterna</em>, \"tern\". The specific <em>albifrons</em> is from Latin <em>albus</em>, \"white\", and \"frons\", <em>forehead</em>. The former North American (<em>S. a. antillarum</em>) and Red Sea <em>S. a. saundersi</em> subspecies are now considered to be separate species, the least tern (<em>Sternula antillarum</em>) and Saunders's tern (<em>Sternula saundersi</em>).<br/><br/>This bird breeds on the coasts and inland waterways of temperate and tropical Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, wintering in the subtropical and tropical oceans as far south as South Africa and Australia.<br/><br/>There are three subspecies, the nominate <em>albifrons</em> occurring in Europe to North Africa and western Asia; <em>guineae</em> of western and central Africa; and <em>sinensis</em> of East Asia and the north and east coasts of Australia.<br/><br/>The little tern breeds in colonies on gravel or shingle coasts and islands. It lays two to four eggs on the ground. Like all white terns, it is defensive of its nest and young and will attack intruders.<br/><br/>Like most other white terns, the little tern feeds by plunge-diving for fish, usually from saline environments. The offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.<br/><br/>This is a small tern, 21&ndash;25&nbsp;cm long with a 41&ndash;47&nbsp;cm wingspan. It is not likely to be confused with other species, apart from fairy tern and Saunders's tern, because of its size and white forehead in breeding plumage. Its thin sharp bill is yellow with a black tip and its legs are also yellow. In winter, the forehead is more extensively white, the bill is black and the legs duller. The call is a loud and distinctive creaking noise.<br/><br/>The little tern was described by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas in 1764 and given the binomial name <em>Sterna albifrons</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The specific <em>hybridus</em> is Latin for <em>hybrid</em>; Pallas thought it might be a hybrid of white-winged black tern and common tern, writing \"<em>Sterna fissipes [</em>Chlidonias leucopterus<em>] et Hirundine [</em>Sterna hirundo<em>] natam</em>&rdquo;.<br/><br/>This bird has a number of geographical races, differing mainly in size and minor plumage details.<br/><br/><em>C. h. hybrida</em> breeds in warmer parts of Europe and Asia. The smaller-billed and darker <em>C. h. delalandii</em> is found in east and south Africa, and the paler <em>C. h. javanicus</em> from Java to Australia.<br/><br/>The tropical forms are resident, but European and Asian birds winter south to Africa and the Indian Subcontinent.<br/><br/>This species breeds in colonies on inland marshes, sometimes amongst black-headed gulls, which provide some protection. The scientific name arises from the fact that this, the largest marsh tern, show similarities in appearance to both the white <em>Sterna</em> terns and to black tern.<br/><br/>The size, black cap, strong bill (29&ndash;34&nbsp;mm in males, 25&ndash;27&nbsp;mm and stubbier in females, with a pronounced gonys) and more positive flight recall common or Arctic tern, but the short, forked-looking tail and dark grey breeding plumage above and below are typically marsh tern characteristics. The summer adult has white cheeks and red legs and bill. The crown is flecked with white in the juvenile, and the hindcrown is more uniformly blackish, though in the winter adult this too is flecked with white. The black ear-coverts are joined to the black of the hindcrown, and the space above is mottled with white, causing the black to appear as a C-shaped band. The sides of the neck are white; this sometimes continues across the nape. The collar is less sharply defined. All through the year the rump is pale grey. In the juvenile, the mantle (279&nbsp;mm) has a variegated pattern. The feathers of the back and scapulars are dark brown, with prominent broad buff edgings and often subterminal buff bars or centers. There is usually an admixture of new gray feathers, especially on the mantle, quite early in the fall. The mantle is silvery-gray in the adult. The call is a characteristic <em>krekk</em>.<br/><br/>In winter, the forehead becomes white and the body plumage a much paler grey. Juvenile whiskered terns have a ginger scaly back, and otherwise look much like winter adults. The first winter plumage is intermediate between juvenile and adult winter, with patchy ginger on the back.<br/><br/>The whiskered tern eats small fish, amphibians, insects and crustaceans.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>white-winged tern</strong>, or <strong>white-winged black tern</strong> (<em>Chlidonias leucopterus</em> or <em>Chlidonias leucoptera</em>), is a species of tern in the family Laridae. It is a small species generally found in or near bodies of fresh water across much of the world, including Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The genus name is from Ancient Greek <em>khelidonios</em>, \"swallow-like\", from <em>khelidon</em>, \"swallow\". The specific <em>leptopterus</em> is also Greek from <em>leptos</em>, \"slender\", and <em>pteros</em>, \"feathered\", itself from <em>pteron</em>, \"wing\".<br/><br/>The name 'white-winged tern' is the standard in most English-speaking countries; in the United Kingdom, this name is also the one used by the formal ornithological recording authorities, but the older alternative 'white-winged black tern' is still frequent in popular use.<br/><br/>Adult birds in summer have short red legs and a short black bill (small and stubby, meausuring 22&ndash;25 mm from the feathers, decidedly shorter than the head), a black neck (often with a pale gray back) and belly, very dark grey back, with a white rump and light grey (almost white) tail, which often looks 'square' in juveniles. The face is tinged yellowish. The wings, as the name implies, are mainly white. The inner wing is grayish with brown-tipped coverts. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black is replaced by white or pale grey, though a few blackish feathers may be retained, admixed with white underparts. A good deal of black shows in the underwing-coverts. The head is black, with a white forehead. The crown is blackish-brown, flecked with white, and the hindcrown is blackish with a certain amount of white flecking. These white markings are pronounced in the winter adult. There is a dark triangular patch forward of the eye. The collar is fairly broad and white. In juveniles and moulting adults, the rump is pale gray, becoming grey in both phases late in the year. The clear white collar and rump isolate the mantle as a dark brown 'saddle'. The mantle feathers have narrow paler brown tips, as have the tertials and scapulars.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>black tern</strong> (<em>Chlidonias niger</em>) is a small tern generally found in or near inland water in Europe and North America. As its name suggests, it has predominantly dark plumage. In some lights it can appear blue in the breeding season, hence the old English name \"blue darr\".The genus name is from Ancient Greek <em>khelidonios</em>, \"swallow-like\", from <em>khelidon</em>, \"swallow\": another old English name for the black tern is \"carr (i.e. lake) swallow\". The species name is from Latin <em>niger</em> \"shining black\".<br/><br/>Adults are 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan 61&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in), and weigh 62&nbsp;g (2.2&nbsp;oz). They have short dark legs and a short, weak-looking black bill, measuring 27&nbsp;mm (1.1&nbsp;in), nearly as long as the head. The bill is long, slender, and looks slightly decurved. They have a dark grey back, with a white forewing, black head, neck (occasionally suffused with grey in the adult) and belly, black or blackish-brown cap (which unites in color with the ear coverts, forming an almost complete hood), and a light brownish-grey, 'square' tail. The face is white. There is a big dark triangular patch in front of the eye, and a broadish white collar in juveniles. There are greyish-brown smudges on the ides of the white breast, a downwards extension of the plumage of the upperparts. These marks vary in size and are not conspicuous. In non-breeding plumage, most of the black, apart from the cap, is replaced by grey. The plumage of the upperparts is drab, with pale feather-edgings. The rump is brownish-grey.<br/><br/>The North American race, <em>C. n. surinamensis</em>, is distinguishable from the European form in all plumages, and is considered by some to be a separate species.<br/><br/>In flight, the build appears slim. The wing-beats are full and dynamic, and flight is often erratic as it dives to the surface for food; similar to other tern species.<br/><br/>Its call has been described as a high-pitched \"kik\"; the sound of a large flock has been called \"deafening\".<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The genus name <em>Sterna</em> is derived from Old English \"stearn\", \"tern\", and the specific <em>dougallii</em> refers to Scottish physician and collector Dr Peter McDougall (1777&ndash;1814). \"Roseate\" refers to the bird's pink breast in breeding plumage.<br/><br/>This is a small-medium tern, 33&ndash;36&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;14&nbsp;in) long with a 67&ndash;76&nbsp;cm (26&ndash;30&nbsp;in) wingspan, which can be confused with the common tern, Arctic tern, and the larger, but similarly plumaged, Sandwich tern. The roseate tern's thin sharp bill is black, with a red base which develops through the breeding season, and is more extensive in the tropical and southern hemisphere races. It is shorter-winged and has faster wing beats than common or Arctic tern. The upper wings are pale grey and its under parts white, and this tern looks very pale in flight, like a small Sandwich tern, although the outermost primary flight feathers darken during the summer. The adults have very long, flexible tail streamers and orange-red legs. In summer, the underparts of adults take on the pinkish tinge which gives this bird its name.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Sterna",
			"species": "hirundo",
			"Description": "The <strong>common tern</strong> (<em>Sterna hirundo</em>) is a seabird in the family Laridae. This bird has a circumpolar distribution, its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of Europe, Asia and North America. It is strongly migratory, wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions. Breeding adults have light grey upperparts, white to very light grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill. Depending on the subspecies, the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black. There are a number of similar species, including the partly sympatric Arctic tern, which can be separated on plumage details, leg and bill colour, or vocalisations.<br/><br/>Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives, the common tern nests on any flat, poorly vegetated surface close to water, including beaches and islands, and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts. The nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel, but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available. Up to three eggs may be laid, their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach. Incubation is by both sexes, and the eggs hatch in around 21&ndash;22 days, longer if the colony is disturbed by predators. The downy chicks fledge in 22&ndash;28&nbsp;days. Like most terns, this species feeds by plunge-diving for fish, either in the sea or in freshwater, but molluscs, crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas.<br/><br/>Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and American mink, and large birds including gulls, owls and herons. Common terns may be infected by lice, parasitic worms, and mites, although blood parasites appear to be rare. Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern, although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades. Despite international legislation protecting the common tern, in some areas populations are threatened by habitat loss, pollution or the disturbance of breeding colonies.<br/><br/>The nominate subspecies of the common tern is 31&ndash;35&nbsp;cm (12&ndash;14&nbsp;in) long, including a 6&ndash;9&nbsp;cm (2.4&ndash;3.5&nbsp;in) fork in the tail, with a 77&ndash;98&nbsp;cm (30&ndash;39&nbsp;in) wingspan. It weighs 110&ndash;141&nbsp;g (3.9&ndash;5.0&nbsp;oz). Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts, very pale grey underparts, a black cap, orange-red legs, and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip, or all black, depending on the subspecies. The common tern's upperwings are pale grey, but as the summer wears on, the dark feather shafts of the outer flight feathers become exposed, and a grey wedge appears on the wings. The rump and tail are white, and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips, unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings. There are no significant differences between the sexes. In non-breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white, the bill is all black or black with a red base, and the legs are dark red or black. The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing, the carpal bar. Terns that have not bred successfully may start moulting into non-breeding adult plumage from June, but late July is more typical, with the moult suspended during migration. There is also some geographical variation, Californian birds often being in non-breeding plumage during migration.<br/><br/>Juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar. The crown and nape are brown, and the forehead is ginger, wearing to white by autumn. The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling, and the tail lacks the adult's long outer feathers. Birds in their first post-juvenile plumage, which normally remain in their wintering areas, resemble the non-breeding adult, but have a duskier crown, dark carpal bar, and often very worn plumage. By their second year, most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults, or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead.<br/><br/>The common tern is an agile flyer, capable of rapid turns and swoops, hovering, and vertical take-off. When commuting with fish, it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind, but 10&ndash;30&nbsp;m (33&ndash;98&nbsp;ft) above the water in a following wind. Unless migrating, normally it stays below 100&nbsp;m (330&nbsp;ft), and averages 30&nbsp;km/h (19&nbsp;mph) in the absence of a tail wind. Its average flight speed during the nocturnal migration flight is 43&ndash;54&nbsp;km/h (27&ndash;34&nbsp;mph) at a height of 1,000&ndash;3,000&nbsp;m (3,300&ndash;9,800&nbsp;ft)<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Sandwich tern</strong> (<em>Thalasseus sandvicensis</em>) is a tern in the family Laridae. It is very closely related to the lesser crested tern (<em>T. bengalensis</em>), Chinese crested tern (<em>T. bernsteini</em>), Cabot's tern (<em>T. acuflavidus</em>), and elegant tern (<em>T. elegans</em>) and has been known to interbreed with the lesser crested.<br/><br/>The Sandwich tern is a medium-large tern with grey upperparts, white underparts, a yellow-tipped black bill and a shaggy black crest which becomes less extensive in winter with a white crown. Young birds bear grey and brown scalloped plumage on their backs and wings. It is a vocal bird. It nests in a ground scrape and lays one to three eggs.<br/><br/>Like all <em>Thalasseus</em> terns, the Sandwich tern feeds by plunge diving for fish, usually in marine environments, and the offering of fish by the male to the female is part of the courtship display.<br/><br/>This is a medium-large tern, 37&ndash;43&nbsp;cm (15&ndash;17&nbsp;in) long with an 85&ndash;97&nbsp;cm (33&ndash;38&nbsp;in) wingspan, which is unlikely to be confused within most of its range, although the South American race could be confused with the elegant tern.<br/><br/>The Sandwich tern's thin sharp bill is black with a yellow tip, except in the yellow or orange billed South American race. Its short legs are black. Its upperwings are pale grey and its underparts white, and this tern looks very pale in flight, although the primary flight feathers darken during the summer.<br/><br/>The lesser crested tern and elegant tern differ in having all-orange bills; lesser crested also differs in having a grey rump and marginally stouter bill, and elegant in having a slightly longer, slenderer bill. Chinese crested tern is the most similar to Sandwich, but has a reversal of the bill colour, yellow with a black tip; it does not overlap in range with Sandwich tern so confusion is unlikely.<br/><br/>In winter, the adult Sandwich tern's forehead becomes white. Juvenile Sandwich terns have dark tips to their tails, and a scaly appearance on their back and wings, like juvenile roseate terns.<br/><br/>The Sandwich tern is a vocal bird; its call is a characteristic loud grating <em>kear-ik</em> or <em>kerr ink</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>western osprey</strong> (<em>Pandion haliaetus</em>) is a diurnal, fish-eating bird of prey. It is a large raptor, reaching more than 60&nbsp;cm (24&nbsp;in) in length and 180&nbsp;cm (71&nbsp;in) across the wings. It is brown on the upperparts and predominantly greyish on the head and underparts.<br/><br/>Most taxonomic authorities lump this species and the eastern osprey together (called the osprey), but some (including the International Ornithologists' Union separate them.<br/><br/>The western osprey tolerates a wide variety of habitats, nesting in any location near a body of water providing an adequate food supply.<br/><br/>As its other common names suggest, the western osprey's diet consists almost exclusively of fish. It possesses specialised physical characteristics and exhibits unique behaviour to assist in hunting and catching prey. As a result of these unique characteristics, it has been given its own taxonomic genus, <em><strong>Pandion</strong></em> and family, <strong>Pandionidae</strong>.<br/><br/>The western osprey is 0.9&ndash;2.1&nbsp;kg (2.0&ndash;4.6&nbsp;lb) in weight and 50&ndash;66&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;26&nbsp;in) in length with a 127&ndash;180&nbsp;cm (50&ndash;71&nbsp;in) wingspan. It is, thus, of similar size to the largest members of the <em>Buteo</em> or <em>Falco</em> genera. The subspecies are fairly close in size, with the nominate subspecies averaging 1.53&nbsp;kg (3.4&nbsp;lb), <em>P. h. carolinensis</em> averaging 1.7&nbsp;kg (3.7&nbsp;lb). The wing chord measures 38 to 52&nbsp;cm (15 to 20&nbsp;in), the tail measures 16.5 to 24&nbsp;cm (6.5 to 9.4&nbsp;in) and the tarsus is 5.2&ndash;6.6&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;2.6&nbsp;in). The upperparts are a deep, glossy brown, while the breast is white and sometimes streaked with brown, and the underparts are pure white. The head is white with a dark mask across the eyes, reaching to the sides of the neck. The irises of the eyes are golden to brown, and the transparent nictitating membrane is pale blue. The bill is black, with a blue cere, and the feet are white with black talons. A short tail and long, narrow wings with four long, finger-like feathers, and a shorter fifth, give it a very distinctive appearance.<br/><br/>The sexes appear fairly similar, but the adult male can be distinguished from the female by its slimmer body and narrower wings. The breast band of the male is also weaker than that of the female, or is non-existent, and the underwing coverts of the male are more uniformly pale. It is straightforward to determine the sex in a breeding pair, but harder with individual birds.<br/><br/>The juvenile western osprey may be identified by buff fringes to the plumage of the upperparts, a buff tone to the underparts, and streaked feathers on the head. During spring, barring on the underwings and flight feathers is a better indicator of a young bird, due to wear on the upperparts.<br/><br/>In flight, the western osprey has arched wings and drooping \"hands\", giving it a gull-like appearance. The call is a series of sharp whistles, described as <em>cheep, cheep</em> or <em>yewk, yewk</em>. If disturbed by activity near the nest, the call is a frenzied <em>cheereek</em>!<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

This kite is distinctive, with long-wings, white, grey and black plumage and owl like forward-facing eyes with red irises. Although mainly seen on the plains, they are sometimes seen on grassy slopes of hills in the higher elevation regions of Asia. They are not migratory, but make short-distance movements in response to weather.<br/><br/>This long-winged raptor is predominantly grey or white with black shoulder patches, wing tips and eye stripe. The long falcon-like wings extend beyond the tail when the bird is perched. In flight, the short and square tail is visible and it is not forked as in the typical kites of the genus <em>Milvus</em>. When perched, often on roadside wires, it often adjusts its wings and jerks its tail up and down as if to balance itself. The sexes are alike in plumage.

			"Description": "The <strong>Egyptian vulture</strong> (<em>Neophron percnopterus</em>), also called the <strong>white scavenger vulture</strong> or <strong>pharaoh's chicken</strong>, is a small Old World vulture and the only member of the genus <em>Neophron</em>. It is widely distributed; the Egyptian vulture is found from southwestern Europe and northern Africa to India. The contrasting underwing pattern and wedge-shaped tail make it distinctive in flight as it soars in thermals during the warmer parts of the day. Egyptian vultures feed mainly on carrion but are opportunistic and will prey on small mammals, birds, and reptiles. They also feed on the eggs of other birds, breaking larger ones by tossing a large pebble onto them. The use of tools is rare in birds and apart from the use of a pebble as a hammer, Egyptian vultures also use twigs to roll up wool for use in their nest. Egyptian vultures that breed in the temperate regions migrate south in winter while tropical populations are relatively sedentary. Populations of this species have declined in the 20th century and some island populations are endangered by hunting, accidental poisoning, and collision with power lines.<br/><br/>The adult's plumage is white, with black flight feathers in the wings. Wild birds usually appear soiled with a rusty or brown shade to the white plumage, derived from mud or iron-rich soil. Captive specimens without access to soil have clean white plumage. It has been suggested as a case of cosmetic colouration. The bill is slender and long, and the tip of the upper mandible is hooked. The nostril is an elongated horizontal slit. The neck feathers are long and form a hackle. The wings are pointed, with the third primary being the longest; the tail is wedge shaped. The legs are pink in adults and grey in juveniles. The claws are long and straight, and the third and fourth toes are slightly webbed at the base.<br/><br/>The bill is black in the nominate subspecies but pale or yellowish in adults of the smaller Indian <em>ginginianus</em>. Rasmussen and Anderton (2005) suggest that this variation may need further study, particularly due to the intermediate black-tipped bill described in <em>rubripersonatus</em>. The facial skin is yellow and unfeathered down to the throat. The sexes are indistinguishable in plumage but breeding males have a deeper orange facial skin colour than females. Females average slightly larger and are about 10&ndash;15% heavier than males. Young birds are blackish or chocolate brown with black and white patches. The adult plumage is attained only after about five years.<br/><br/>The adult Egyptian vulture measures 47&ndash;65 centimetres (19&ndash;26&nbsp;in) from the point of the beak to the extremity of the tail feathers. In the smaller <em>N. p. ginginianus</em> males are about 47&ndash;52 centimetres (19&ndash;20&nbsp;in) long while females are 52&ndash;55.5 centimetres (20.5&ndash;21.9&nbsp;in) long. The wingspan is about 2.7 times the body length. Birds from Spain weigh about 1.9 kilograms (4.2&nbsp;lb) while birds of the Canary Island subspecies <em>majorensis</em>, representing a case of island gigantism, are heavier with an average weight of 2.4 kilograms (5.3&nbsp;lb)<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>cinereous vulture</strong> (<em>Aegypius monachus</em>) is a large raptorial bird that is distributed through much of Eurasia. It is also known as the <strong>black vulture</strong>, <strong>monk vulture</strong>, or <strong>Eurasian black vulture</strong>. It is a member of the family Accipitridae, which also includes many other diurnal raptors such as kites, buzzards and harriers. It is one of the two largest Old World vultures, attaining a maximum size of 14&nbsp;kg, 1.2 m long and 3.1 m across the wings.<br/><br/>The cinereous vulture measures 98&ndash;120&nbsp;cm (3&nbsp;ft 3&nbsp;in&ndash;3&nbsp;ft 11&nbsp;in) long with a 2.5&ndash;3.1&nbsp;m (8&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in&ndash;10&nbsp;ft 2&nbsp;in) wingspan. Males can weigh from 6.3 to 11.5&nbsp;kg (14 to 25&nbsp;lb), whereas females can weigh from 7.5 to 14&nbsp;kg (17 to 31&nbsp;lb). It is thus one of the world's heaviest flying birds. Females are slightly larger than males. Despite limited genetic variation in the species, body size increases from west to east, with the birds from southwest Europe (Spain and south France) averaging about 10% smaller than the vultures from central Asia (Manchuria, Mongolia and northern China). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 73&ndash;89&nbsp;cm (29&ndash;35&nbsp;in), the tail is 33&ndash;41&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;16&nbsp;in) and the tarsus is 12&ndash;14.6&nbsp;cm (4.7&ndash;5.7&nbsp;in).<br/><br/>The cinereous vulture is distinctly dark, with the whole body being brown excepting the pale head in adults, which is covered in fine blackish down. This down is absent in the closely related lappet-faced vulture (<em>Torgos tracheliotos</em>). The skin of the head and neck is bluish-gray and a paler whitish color above the eye. The adult has brown eyes, a purplish cere, a blue-gray bill and pale blue-gray legs. The primary quills are often actually black. From a distance, flying birds can easily appear all black. The immature plumage is sepia-brown above, with a much paler underside than in adults. Immature cinereous vultures have grey down on the head, a pale mauve cere and grey legs. The massive bill is the largest of any living accipiterid, a feature enhanced by the relatively small skull of the species. The exposed culmen of the cinereous vulture measures 8&ndash;9&nbsp;cm (3.1&ndash;3.5&nbsp;in). The wings, with serrated leading edges, are held straight or slightly arched in flight and are broad, sometimes referred to as \"barn door wings\". Their flight is slow and buoyant, with deep, heavy flaps when necessary. The combination of huge size and dark coloration renders the cinereous vulture relatively distinct, especially against smaller raptors such as eagles or hawks. The most similar-shaped species, the lappet-faced vulture (with which there might be limited range overlap in the southern Middle East), is distinguished by its bare, pinkish head and contrasting plumage. On the lappet-face, the thighs and belly are whitish in adult birds against black to brownish over the remainder of the plumage. All potential <em>Gyps</em> vultures are distinguished by having paler, often streaky plumage, with bulging wing primaries giving them a less evenly broad-winged form. Cinereous vultures are generally very silent, with a few querulous mewing, roaring or guttural cries solely between adults and their offspring at the nest site.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>western marsh harrier</strong> (<em>Circus aeruginosus</em>) is a large harrier, a bird of prey from temperate and subtropical western Eurasia and adjacent Africa. It is also known as the <strong>Eurasian marsh harrier</strong>. The genus name <em>Circus</em> is derived from the Ancient Greek <em>kirkos</em>, referring to a bird of prey named for its circling flight (<em>kirkos</em>, \"circle\"), probably the hen harrier. The specific <em>aeruginosus</em> is Latin for \"rusty\".<br/><br/>Formerly, a number of relatives were included in <em>C. aeruginosus</em>, which was then known as <strong>\"marsh harrier\"</strong>. The related taxa are now generally considered to be separate species: the eastern marsh harrier (<em>C. spilonotus</em>) and the possibly distinct Papuan harrier (<em>C. (s.) spilothorax</em>) of eastern Asia and the Wallacea, the swamp harrier (<em>C. approximans</em>) of Australasia and the Madagascar marsh harrier (<em>C. maillardi</em>) of the western Indian Ocean islands.<br/><br/>The western marsh harrier is often divided into two subspecies, the widely migratory <em>C. a. aeruginosus</em> which is found across most of its range, and <em>C. a. harterti</em> which is resident all-year in north-west Africa.<br/><br/>The western marsh harrier is 43 to 54&nbsp;cm (17 to 21&nbsp;in) in length, has a wingspan of 115 to 130&nbsp;cm (45 to 51&nbsp;in) and a weight of 400 to 650&nbsp;g (14 to 23&nbsp;oz) in males and 500 to 800&nbsp;g (18 to 28&nbsp;oz) in females. It is a large, bulky harrier with fairly broad wings, and has a strong and peculiar sexual dichromatism. The male's plumage is mostly a cryptic reddish-brown with lighter yellowish streaks, which are particularly prominent on the breast. The head and shoulders are mostly pale greyish-yellowish. The rectrices and the secondary and tertiary remiges are pure grey, the latter contrasting with the brown forewing and the black primary remiges at the wingtips. The upperside and underside of the wing look similar, though the brown is lighter on the underwing. Whether from the side or below, flying males appear characteristically three-colored brown-grey-black. The legs, feet, irides and the cere of the black bill are yellow.<br/><br/>The female is almost entirely chocolate-brown. The top of the head, the throat and the shoulders have of a conspicuously lighter yellowish colour; this can be clearly delimited and very contrasting, or (particularly in worn plumage) be more washed-out, resembling the male's head colours. But the eye area of the female is always darker, making the light eye stand out, while the male's head is altogether not very contrastingly coloured and the female lacks the grey wing-patch and tail. Juveniles are similar to females, but usually have less yellow, particularly on the shoulders.<br/><br/>There is a rare hypermelanic morph with largely dark plumage. It is most often found in the east of the species' range. Juveniles of this morph may look entirely black in flight.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The specific <em>cyaneus</em> is Latin, meaning \"dark-blue\".<br/><br/>While many taxonomic authorities split the northern harrier and the hen harrier into distinct species, others consider them conspecific.<br/><br/>It breeds in northern Eurasia. The term \"hen harrier\" refers to its former habit of preying on free-ranging fowl.<br/><br/>It migrates to more southerly areas in winter. Eurasian birds move to southern Europe and southern temperate Asia, In the mildest regions, such as France, Great Britain.<br/><br/>The hen harrier is 41&ndash;52&nbsp;cm (16&ndash;20&nbsp;in) long with a 97&ndash;122&nbsp;cm (38&ndash;48&nbsp;in) wingspan. It resembles other harriers in having distinct male and female plumages. The sexes also differ in weight, with males weighing 290 to 400&nbsp;g (10 to 14&nbsp;oz), with an average of 350&nbsp;g (12&nbsp;oz), and females weighing 390 to 750&nbsp;g (14 to 26&nbsp;oz), with an average of 530&nbsp;g (19&nbsp;oz).

It is relatively long winged and long tailed, having the longest wing and tail relative to its body size of any raptor occurring in North America.<br/><br/>The male is mainly grey above and white below except for the upper breast, which is grey like the upperparts, and the rump, which is white; the wings are grey with black wingtips. The female is brown above with white upper tail coverts, hence females, and the similar juveniles, are often called \"ringtails\". Their underparts are buff streaked with brown.<br/><br/>In Eurasia, the adult male is sometimes nicknamed the \"Grey Ghost\", because of his striking plumage and spectral aura.<br/><br/>The female gives a whistled <em>piih-eh</em> when receiving food from the male, and her alarm call is <em>chit-it-it-it-it-et-it</em>.

Its common name commemorates the British naturalist George Montagu.<br/><b>Plumage</b> <br/><br/>Sexual dimorphism is particularly apparent in the plumage of this species. Adult males are characterized by their overall pale grey plumage contrasting with black wingtips. Compared with other harriers this species has characteristic black bands along the secondaries, both above and below the wing and rusty streaks on belly and flanks. Adult females have a broadly similar plumage to that of pallid and hen harriers. The underparts are mostly pale yellow-brown, the belly with longitudinal stripes and the wing coverts spotted. The upper parts are uniform dark brown except for the white upper tail coverts (\"rump\"), and the sightly paler central wing coverts.<br/><br/>The juvenile plumage resembles that of the female, but differs by the belly and under wing coverts which are not spotted, but uniformly red brown in colour.<br/><br/>A melanistic form occurs regularly in this species. In this form the male is much darker than usual, with a black head, brownish black above and grey underparts. The melanistic female is entirely chocolate brown except for grey flight feathers. Partially melanistic morphs can also be found.<br/><br/>The Montagu's harrier has a particularly graceful flight, with powerful and elegant wingbeats which give an impression of buoyancy and ease. In true harrier fashion it searches the countryside, flying low, and generally holds its wings with a marked positive dihedral.<br/><br/>The Montagu's harrier is a deceptively small raptor, though it appears larger because of its large wing surface compared to small body weight, which gives it a typically buoyant flight. The female is larger than the male because the female needs to produce eggs, however this is not apparent in the field.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"species": "nisus",
			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian sparrowhawk</strong> (<em>Accipiter nisus</em>), also known as the <strong>northern sparrowhawk</strong> or simply the <strong>sparrowhawk</strong>, is a small bird of prey in the family Accipitridae. Adult male Eurasian sparrowhawks have bluish grey upperparts and orange-barred underparts; females and juveniles are brown above with brown barring below. The female is up to 25% larger than the male &ndash; one of the largest differences between the sexes in any bird species. Though it is a predator which specialises in catching woodland birds, the Eurasian sparrowhawk can be found in any habitat and often hunts garden birds in towns and cities. Males tend to take smaller birds, including tits, finches, and sparrows; females catch primarily thrushes and starlings, but are capable of killing birds weighing 500&nbsp;g (18&nbsp;oz) or more.<br/><br/>The Eurasian sparrowhawk is found throughout the temperate and subtropical parts of the Old World; while birds from the northern parts of the range migrate south for winter, their southern counterparts remain resident or make dispersive movements. Eurasian sparrowhawks breed in suitable woodland of any type, with the nest, measuring up to 60&nbsp;cm (2.0&nbsp;ft) across, built using twigs in a tree. Four or five pale blue, brown-spotted eggs are laid; the success of the breeding attempt is dependent on the female maintaining a high weight while the male brings her food. The chicks hatch after 33 days and fledge after 24 to 28 days.<br/><br/>The probability of a juvenile surviving its first year is 34%, with 69% of adults surviving from one year to the next. Mortality in young males is greater than that of young females and the typical lifespan is four years. This species is now one of the most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and incapacitate others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.<br/><br/>The Eurasian sparrowhawk's hunting behaviour has brought it into conflict with humans for hundreds of years, particularly racing pigeon owners and people rearing poultry and gamebirds. It has also been blamed for decreases in passerine populations. The increase in population of the Eurasian Sparrowhawk coincides with the decline in House Sparrows in Britain. Studies of racing pigeon deaths found that Eurasian sparrowhawks were responsible for less than 1%. Falconers have utilised the Eurasian sparrowhawk since at least the 16th century; although the species has a reputation for being difficult to train, it is also praised for its courage. The species features in Teutonic mythology and is mentioned in works by writers including William Shakespeare, Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Ted Hughes.<br/><br/>The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a small bird of prey with short, broad wings and a long tail, both adaptations to manoeuvring through trees. Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size difference in this direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.<br/><br/>The adult male is 29&ndash;34&nbsp;cm (11&ndash;13&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 59&ndash;64&nbsp;cm (23&ndash;25&nbsp;in) and a mass of 110&ndash;196&nbsp;g (3.9&ndash;6.9&nbsp;oz). He has slate-grey upperparts (sometimes tending to bluish), with finely red-barred underparts, which can look plain orange from a distance; his irides are orange-yellow or orange-red. The female is much larger at 35&ndash;41&nbsp;cm (14&ndash;16&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 67&ndash;80&nbsp;cm (26&ndash;31&nbsp;in), and a mass of 185&ndash;342&nbsp;g (6.5&ndash;12.1&nbsp;oz). She has dark brown or greyish-brown upperparts, and brown-barred underparts, and bright yellow to orange irides. The juvenile is warm brown above, with rusty fringes to the upperparts; and coarsely barred or spotted brown below, with pale yellow eyes; its throat has dark streaks and lacks a mesial (midline) stripe.<br/><br/>The Eurasian sparrowhawk's pale underparts and darker upperparts are an example of countershading, which helps to break up the bird's outline. Countershading is exhibited by birds of prey which hunt birds and other fast-moving animals. The horizontal barring seen on adult Eurasian sparrowhawks is typical of woodland-dwelling predatory birds, while the adult male's bluish colour is also seen in other bird-eating raptors, including the peregrine falcon, the merlin and other <em>Accipiters</em>.<br/><br/>A study, using stuffed bird models, found that small birds are less likely to approach common cuckoos (a brood parasite) which have barred underparts like the Eurasian sparrowhawk. Eurasian reed warblers were found to be more aggressive to cuckoos which looked less hawk-like, meaning that the resemblance to the hawk helps the cuckoo to access the nests of potential hosts.<br/><br/>The Eurasian sparrowhawk's small bill is used for plucking feathers and pulling prey apart, rather than killing or cutting. Its long legs and toes are an adaptation for catching and eating birds. The outer toe is <em>\"fairly long and slender\"</em>; the inner toe and back toe are relatively short and thick. The middle toe is very long and can be used to grasp objects, while a protuberance on the underside of the toe means that the digit can be closed without leaving a gap, which helps with gripping.<br/><br/>The flight is a characteristic \"flap-flap-glide\", with the glide creating an undulating pattern. This species is similar in size to the Levant sparrowhawk, but larger than the shikra (the calls are however different); the male is only slightly larger than the merlin. Because of the overlap in sizes, the female can be confused with the similarly-sized male northern goshawk, but lacks the bulk of that species. Eurasian sparrowhawks are smaller, more slender and have shorter wings, a square-ended tail and fly with faster wingbeats. A confusion species in China is the besra, although <em>A. n. melaschistos</em> is considerably larger.<br/><br/>In Great Britain, Eurasian sparrowhawks living further north are bigger than their more southerly counterparts, with wing length (the most reliable indicator of body size) increasing by an average of 0.86&nbsp;mm (0.034&nbsp;in) in males, and 0.75&nbsp;mm (0.030&nbsp;in) in females, for each degree further north.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is resident in the milder parts of its range in western Europe and northwest Africa, but birds from northeastern and central Europe winter farther south and west, reaching south to Turkey. Vagrants have reached north to Finland and south to Israel, Libya and Gambia.<br/><br/>Red kites are 60 to 70&nbsp;cm (24 to 28&nbsp;in) long with a 175&ndash;179&nbsp;cm (69&ndash;70&nbsp;in) wingspan; males weigh 800&ndash;1,200&nbsp;g (28&ndash;42&nbsp;oz), and females 1,000&ndash;1,300&nbsp;g (35&ndash;46&nbsp;oz). It is an elegant bird, soaring on long wings held at a dihedral, and long forked tail, twisting as it changes direction. The body, upper tail and wing coverts are rufous. The white primary flight feathers contrast with the black wing tips and dark secondaries. Apart from the weight difference, the sexes are similar, but juveniles have a buff breast and belly.

It is thought to be the world's most abundant species of Accipitridae, although some populations have experienced dramatic declines or fluctuations. Current global population estimates run up to 6 million individuals. Unlike others of the group, black kites are opportunistic hunters and are more likely to scavenge. They spend a lot of time soaring and gliding in thermals in search of food. Their angled wing and distinctive forked tail make them easy to identify. They are also vociferous with a shrill whinnying call. This kite is widely distributed through the temperate and tropical parts of Eurasia and parts of Australasia and Oceania, with the temperate region populations tending to be migratory. Several subspecies are recognized and formerly had their own English names. The European populations are small, but the South Asian population is very large.<br/><br/>Black kites can be distinguished from red kites by the slightly smaller size, less forked tail (visible in flight), and generally dark plumage without any rufous. The sexes are alike. The upper plumage is brown but the head and neck tend to be paler. The patch behind the eye appears darker. The outer flight feathers are black and the feathers have dark cross bars and are mottled at the base. The lower parts of the body are pale brown, becoming lighter towards the chin. The body feathers have dark shafts giving it a streaked appearance. The cere and gape are yellow, but the bill is black (unlike in the yellow-billed kite). The legs are yellow and the claws are black. They have a distinctive shrill whistle followed by a rapid whinnying call. Males and females have the same plumage but females are longer than males. Their wingspan is around 150&nbsp;cm.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Over much of its range, it is resident year-round, but birds from the colder parts of the Northern Hemisphere typically migrate south (some well into the Southern Hemisphere) for the northern winter.<br/><br/>The common buzzard measures between 40 and 58&nbsp;cm (16 and 23&nbsp;in) in length with a 109&ndash;140&nbsp;cm (43&ndash;55&nbsp;in) wingspan and a body mass of 427&ndash;1,364&nbsp;g (0.941&ndash;3.007&nbsp;lb), making it a medium-sized raptor.<br/><br/>This broad-winged raptor has a wide variety of plumages, and in Europe can be confused with the similar rough-legged buzzard (<em>Buteo lagopus</em>) and the distantly related European honey buzzard (<em>Pernis apivorus</em>), which mimics the common buzzard's plumage for a degree of protection from northern goshawks. The plumage can vary in Britain from almost pure white to black, but is usually shades of brown, with a pale 'necklace' of feathers.<br/><br/>Of the two eastern subspecies, <em>B. b. vulpinus</em> breeds from east Europe eastward to the Far East (including Eastern China and South Asia), excluding Japan, while <em>B. b. menetriesi</em> breeds in the Southern Crimea and Caucasus to northern Iran. <em>B. b. vulpinus</em> is a long-distance migrant, excepting some north Himalayan birds, and winters in Africa, India and southeastern Asia. In the open country favoured on the wintering grounds, steppe buzzards are often seen perched on roadside telephone poles.<br/><br/>The steppe buzzard is some times split off as a separate species, <em>B. vulpinus</em>. Compared to the nominate form, it is slightly smaller (45&ndash;50&nbsp;cm (18&ndash;20&nbsp;in) long), longer winged and longer tailed. The two colour morphs are the rufous form which gives this subspecies its scientific name (<em>vulpes</em> is Latin for \"fox\") and a dark grey form.<br/><br/>The tail of <em>B. vulpinus</em> is paler than the nominate form, and often quite rufous, recalling North American red-tailed hawk. The upper wings have pale primary patches, and the primary flight feathers are also paler when viewed from below. Adults have a black trailing edge to the wings, and both morphs often have plain underparts, lacking the breast band frequently seen in <em>B. b. buteo</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Tyto",
			"species": "alba",
			"Description": "The <strong>western barn owl</strong> (<em>Tyto alba</em>) is usually considered a subspecies group and together with the American barn owl group, the eastern barn owl group, and sometimes the Andaman masked owl make up the barn owl. The cosmopolitan barn owl is recognized by most taxonomic authorities. A few (including the International Ornithologists' Union) separate them into distinct species, as is done here. The western barn owl is native to Eurasia and Africa.<br/><br/>Like most owls, the barn owl is nocturnal, relying on its acute sense of hearing when hunting in complete darkness. It often becomes active shortly before dusk and can sometimes be seen during the day when relocating from one roosting site to another. In Britain, it sometimes hunts by day. This practice may depend on whether the owl is mobbed by other birds if it emerges in daylight. However, in Britain, some birds continue to hunt by day even when mobbed by such birds as magpies, rooks and black-headed gulls, such diurnal activity possibly occurring when the previous night has been wet making hunting difficult. By contrast, in southern Europe and the tropics, the birds seem to be almost exclusively nocturnal, with the few birds that hunt by day being severely mobbed.<br/><br/>Barn owls are not particularly territorial but have a home range inside which they forage. For males in Scotland this has a radius of about 1&nbsp;km (0.6&nbsp;mi) from the nest site and an average size of about 300 hectares. Female home ranges largely coincide with that of their mates. Outside the breeding season, males and females usually roost separately, each one having about three favoured sites in which to conceal themselves by day, and which are also visited for short periods during the night. Roosting sites include holes in trees, fissures in cliffs, disused buildings, chimneys and haysheds and are often small in comparison to nesting sites. As the breeding season approaches, the birds move back to the vicinity of the chosen nest to roost.<br/><br/>The barn owl is a bird of open country such as farmland or grassland with some interspersed woodland, usually at altitudes below 2,000 metres (6,600&nbsp;ft) but occasionally as high as 3,000 metres (9,800&nbsp;ft) in the tropics. This owl prefers to hunt along the edges of woods or in rough grass strips adjoining pasture. It has an effortless wavering flight as it quarters the ground, alert to the sounds made by potential prey. Like most owls, the barn owl flies silently; tiny serrations on the leading edges of its flight feathers and a hairlike fringe to the trailing edges help to break up the flow of air over the wings, thereby reducing turbulence and the noise that accompanies it. Hairlike extensions to the barbules of its feathers, which give the plumage a soft feel, also minimise noise produced during wingbeats. The behaviour and ecological preferences may differ slightly even among neighbouring subspecies, as shown in the case of the European <em>T. a. guttata</em> and <em>T. a. alba</em> that probably evolved, respectively, in allopatric glacial refugia in southeastern Europe, and in Iberia or southern France.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"species": "noctua",
			"Description": "The <strong>little owl</strong> (<em>Athene noctua</em>) is a bird that inhabits much of the temperate and warmer parts of Europe, Asia east to Korea, and north Africa. It was introduced into Britain at the end of the nineteenth century and into the South Island of New Zealand in the early twentieth century.<br/><br/>This owl is a member of the typical or true owl family, Strigidae, which contains most species of owl, the other grouping being the barn owls, Tytonidae. It is a small, cryptically coloured, mainly nocturnal species and is found in a range of habitats including farmland, woodland fringes, steppes and semi-deserts. It feeds on insects, earthworms, other invertebrates and small vertebrates. Males hold territories which they defend against intruders. This owl is a cavity nester and a clutch of about four eggs is laid in spring. The female does the incubation and the male brings food to the nest, first for the female and later for the newly hatched young. As the chicks grow, both parents hunt and bring them food, and the chicks leave the nest at about seven weeks of age.<br/><br/>Being a common species with a wide range and large total population, the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as \"least concern\".<br/><br/>The little owl is a small owl with a flat-topped head, a plump, compact body and a short tail. The facial disc is flattened above the eyes giving the bird a frowning expression. The plumage is greyish-brown, spotted, streaked and barred with white. The underparts are pale and streaked with darker colour. It is usually 22 centimetres (8.7&nbsp;in) in length with a wingspan of 56 centimetres (22&nbsp;in) for both sexes, and weighs about 180 grams (6.3&nbsp;oz).<br/><br/>The adult little owl of the most widespread form, the nominate <em>A. n. noctua</em>, is white-speckled brown above, and brown-streaked white below. It has a large head, long legs, and yellow eyes, and its white &ldquo;eyebrows&rdquo; give it a stern expression. Juveniles are duller, and lack the adult's white crown spots. This species has a bounding flight like a woodpecker but the rounded wingtips and general appearance of the birds are quite different. Moult begins in July and continues to November, with male starting before female.<br/><br/>The call is a querulous <em>kiew, kiew</em>. Less frequently, various whistling or trilling calls are uttered. In the breeding season, other more modulated calls are made, and a pair may call in duet. Various yelping, chattering or barking sounds are made in the vicinity of the nest.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>short-eared owl</strong> (<em>Asio flammeus</em>) is a species of typical owl (family Strigidae). Owls belonging to genus <em>Asio</em> are known as the eared owls, as they have tufts of feathers resembling mammalian ears. These 'ear' tufts may or may not be visible. <em>Asio flammeus</em> will display its tufts when in a defensive pose, although its very short tufts are usually not visible. The short-eared owl is found in open country and grasslands. The scientific name is from Latin. The genus name <em>Asio</em> is a type of eared owl, and <em>flammeus</em> means 'flame-coloured'.<br/><br/> The short-eared owl is a medium-sized owl measuring 34&ndash;43&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;17&nbsp;in) in length and weighing 206&ndash;475&nbsp;g (7.3&ndash;16.8&nbsp;oz). It has large eyes, a big head, a short neck, and broad wings. Its bill is short, strong, hooked and black. Its plumage is mottled tawny to brown with a barred tail and wings. The upper breast is significantly streaked. Its flight is characteristically floppy due to its irregular wingbeats. The short-eared owl may also be described as 'moth or bat - like' in flight. Wingspans range from 85 to 110&nbsp;cm (33 to 43&nbsp;in).<sup>[6]</sup> Females are slightly larger than males. The yellow-orange eyes of <em>A. flammeus</em> are exaggerated by black rings encircling each eye, giving the appearance of them wearing mascara, and large, whitish disks of plumage surrounding the eyes like a mask.<br/><br/>Over much of its range, short-eared owls occurs with the similar-looking long-eared owl. At rest, the ear-tufts of long-eared owl serve to easily distinguish the two (although long-eared owl can sometimes hold its ear-tufts flat). The iris-colour differs: yellow in short-eared, and orange in long-eared, and the black surrounding the eyes is vertical on long-eared, and horizontal on short-eared. Overall the short-eared tends to be a paler, sandier bird than the long-eared. There are a number of other ways in which the two species the differ which are best seen when they are flying: a) short-eared often has a broad white band along the rear edge of the wing, which is not shown by long-eared; b) on the upperwing, short-eared owls' primary-patches are usually paler and more obvious; c) the band on the upper side of short-eared owl's tail are usually bolder than those of long-eared; d) short-eared's innermost secondaries are often dark-marked, contrasting with the rest of the underwing; e) the long-eared owl has streaking throughout its underparts whereas on short-eared the streaking ends at the breast; f) the dark markings on the underside of the tips of the longest primaries are bolder on short-eared owl; g) the upperparts are coarsely blotched, whereas on long-eared they are more finely marked. The short-eared owl also differs structurally from the long-eared, having longer, slimmer wings: the long-eared owl has wings shaped more like those of a tawny owl. The long-eared owl generally has different habitat preferences from the short-eared, most often being found concealed in areas with dense wooded thickets. The short-eared owl is often most regularly seen flying about in early morning or late day as it hunts over open habitats.<br/><br/>&nbsp;(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian wryneck</strong> (<em>Jynx torquilla</em>) is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family. This species mainly breeds in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian Subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards.<br/><br/>Eurasian wrynecks measure about 16.5&nbsp;cm (6.5&nbsp;in) in length and have bills shorter and less dagger-like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white as is the case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June.<br/><br/>These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a \"jinx\" on someone.<br/><br/>The Eurasian wryneck grows to about 17&nbsp;cm (6.7&nbsp;in) in length. The subspecies <em>Jynx torquilla tschusii</em> weighs 26 to 50&nbsp;g (0.92 to 1.76&nbsp;oz). It is a slim, elongated-looking bird with a body shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker. The upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. The rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown. The rounded tail is grey, speckled with brown, with faint bands of greyish-brown and a few more clearly defined bands of brownish-black. The cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown. The underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow-heads which are reduced to spots on the lower breast and belly. The flanks are buff with similar markings and the under-tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars. The primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous-buff markings. The beak is brown, long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip. The irises are hazel and the slender legs and feet are pale brown. The first and second toes are shorter than the others. The first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces.<br/><br/>The call of the Eurasian wryneck is a series of repeated harsh, shrill notes <em>quee-quee-quee-quee</em> lasting for several seconds and is reminiscent of the voice of the lesser spotted woodpecker. Its alarm call is a short series of staccato \"tuck\"s and when disturbed on the nest it hisses.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It feeds mainly on fish, caught by diving, and has special visual adaptations to enable it to see prey under water. The glossy white eggs are laid in a nest at the end of a burrow in a riverbank.<br/><br/>his species has the typical short-tailed, dumpy-bodied large-headed and long-billed kingfisher shape. The adult male of the western European subspecies, <em>A. a. ispida</em> has green-blue upperparts with pale azure-blue back and rump, a rufous patch by the bill base, and a rufous ear-patch. It has a green-blue neck stripe, white neck blaze and throat, rufous underparts, and a black bill with some red at the base. The legs and feet are bright red. It is about 16 centimetres (6.3&nbsp;in) long with a wingspan of 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in), and weighs 34&ndash;46 grams (1.2&ndash;1.6&nbsp;oz).<br/><br/>The female is identical in appearance to the male except that her lower mandible is orange-red with a black tip. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but with duller and greener upperparts and paler underparts. Its bill is black, and the legs are also initially black. Feathers are moulted gradually between July and November with the main flight feathers taking 90&ndash;100 days to moult and regrow. Some that moult late may suspend their moult during cold winter weather.<br/><br/>The flight of the kingfisher is fast, direct and usually low over water. The short rounded wings whirr rapidly, and a bird flying away shows an electric-blue \"flash\" down its back.<br/><br/>In North Africa, Europe and Asia north of the Himalayas this is the only small blue kingfisher. In south and southeast Asia it can be confused with six other small blue-and-rufous kingfishers, but the rufous ear patches distinguish it from all but juvenile blue-eared kingfisher; details of the head pattern may be necessary to differentiate the two species where both occur.<br/><br/>The common kingfisher has no song. The flight call is a short sharp whistle, <em>chee</em>, repeated two or three times. Anxious birds emit a harsh, <em>shrit-it-it</em> and nestlings call for food with a churring noise.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

The call is a diagnostic harsh <em>chay-chay-chay</em>, unlike the common kestrel's <em>kee-kee-kee</em>. Neither sex has dark talons as is usual in falcons; those of this species are a peculiar whitish-horn color. This, however, is only conspicuous when birds are seen at very close range, e.g. in captivity.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>common kestrel</strong> (<em>Falco tinnunculus</em>) is a bird of prey species belonging to the kestrel group of the falcon family Falconidae. It is also known as the <strong>European kestrel</strong>, <strong>Eurasian kestrel</strong>, or <strong>Old World kestrel</strong>. In Britain, where no other kestrel species occurs, it is generally just called \"the <strong>kestrel</strong>\".<br/><br/>This species occurs over a large range. It is widespread in Europe, Asia, and Africa, as well as occasionally reaching the east coast of North America. But although it has colonized a few oceanic islands, vagrant individuals are generally rare; in the whole of Micronesia for example, the species was only recorded twice each on Guam and Saipan in the Marianas.<br/><br/>Common kestrels measure 32&ndash;39&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;15&nbsp;in) from head to tail, with a wingspan of 65&ndash;82&nbsp;cm (26&ndash;32&nbsp;in). Females are noticeably larger, with the adult male weighing 136&ndash;252&nbsp;g (4.8&ndash;8.9&nbsp;oz), around 155&nbsp;g (5.5&nbsp;oz) on average; the adult female weighs 154&ndash;314&nbsp;g (5.4&ndash;11.1&nbsp;oz), around 184&nbsp;g (6.5&nbsp;oz) on average. They are thus small compared with other birds of prey, but larger than most songbirds. Like the other <em>Falco</em> species, they have long wings as well as a distinctive long tail.<br/><br/>Their plumage is mainly light chestnut brown with blackish spots on the upperside and buff with narrow blackish streaks on the underside; the remiges are also blackish. Unlike most raptors, they display sexual colour dimorphism with the male having fewer black spots and streaks, as well as a blue-grey cap and tail. The tail is brown with black bars in females, and has a black tip with a narrow white rim in both sexes. All common kestrels have a prominent black malar stripe like their closest relatives.<br/><br/>The cere, feet, and a narrow ring around the eye are bright yellow; the toenails, bill and iris are dark. Juveniles look like adult females, but the underside streaks are wider; the yellow of their bare parts is paler. Hatchlings are covered in white down feathers, changing to a buff-grey second down coat before they grow their first true plumage.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "<strong>Eleonora's falcon</strong> (<em>Falco eleonorae</em>) is a medium-sized falcon. It belongs to the hobby group, a rather close-knit number of similar falcons often considered a subgenus <em>Hypotriorchis</em>. The sooty falcon is sometimes considered its closest relative, but while they certainly belong to the same lineage, they do not seem to be close sister species. Eleonora's falcon is named after Eleanor of Arborea, Queen (<em>Juighissa</em>) and national heroine of Sardinia, who granted for the first time in history the protection of bird nests against illegal hunters in 1392 under the jurisdiction conferred by the Carta de Logu. The genus name <em>falco</em> is from Late Latin <em>falx</em>, <em>falcis</em>, a sickle, referring to the claws of the bird. The species name <em>eleonorae</em> again commemorates the Sardinian Eleanor of Arborea, who passed a law protecting nesting hawks and falcons.<br/><br/>Eleonora's falcon is an elegant bird of prey, 36&ndash;42&nbsp;cm (14&ndash;17&nbsp;in) long with an 87&ndash;104&nbsp;cm (34&ndash;41&nbsp;in) wingspan. It is shaped like a large Eurasian hobby or a small slender peregrine falcon, with its long pointed wings, long tail and slim body. There are two colour morphs: The adult dark morph is all sooty brown, with black underwing coverts. The light morph is more like a juvenile Eurasian hobby, but has buff underparts, and also shows the contrast between the black underwing coverts and paler base to the flight feathers. Young birds are also like a large juvenile hobby, but the pale underparts contrast with darker wingtips and wing coverts. The call is a typical falcon <em>kek-kek-kek</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Falco",
			"species": "columbarius",
			"Description": "The <strong>Merlin</strong> (<em>Falco columbarius</em>) is a small species of falcon from the Northern Hemisphere, with numerous subspecies throughout North America and Eurasia. A bird of prey once known colloquially as a <strong>pigeon hawk</strong> in North America, the Merlin breeds in the northern Holarctic; some migrate to subtropical and northern tropical regions in winter. Males typically have wingspans of 53&ndash;58 centimetres (21&ndash;23&nbsp;in), with females being slightly larger. They are swift fliers and skilled hunters who specialize in preying on small birds in the size range of sparrows to quail. The Merlin has for centuries been well regarded as a falconry bird. In recent decades merlin populations in North America have been significantly increasing, with some merlins becoming so well adapted to city life that they forgo migration.<br/><br/>The merlin is 24&ndash;33&nbsp;cm (9.4&ndash;13.0&nbsp;in) long with a 50&ndash;73&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;29&nbsp;in) wingspan. Compared with most other small falcons, it is more robust and heavily built. Males average at about 165&nbsp;g (5.8&nbsp;oz) and females are typically about 230&nbsp;g (8.1&nbsp;oz). There is considerable variation, however, throughout the birds' range and&mdash;in particular in migratory populations&mdash;over the course of a year. Thus, adult males may weigh 125&ndash;210&nbsp;g (4.4&ndash;7.4&nbsp;oz), and females 190&ndash;300&nbsp;g (6.7&ndash;10.6&nbsp;oz). Each wing measures 18.2&ndash;23.8&nbsp;cm (7.2&ndash;9.4&nbsp;in), the tail measures 12.7&ndash;18.5&nbsp;cm (5.0&ndash;7.3&nbsp;in) and the tarsus measures 3.7&nbsp;cm (1.5&nbsp;in). Such sexual dimorphism is common among raptors; it allows males and females to hunt different prey animals and decreases the territory size needed to feed a mated pair.<br/><br/>The male merlin has a blue-grey back, ranging from almost black to silver-grey in different subspecies. Its underparts are buff- to orange-tinted and more or less heavily streaked with black to reddish brown. The female and immature are brownish-grey to dark brown above, and whitish buff spotted with brown below. Besides a weak whitish supercilium and the faint dark malar stripe&mdash;which are barely recognizable in both the palest and the darkest birds&mdash;the face of the merlin is less strongly patterned than in most other falcons. Nestlings are covered in pale buff down feathers, shading to whitish on the belly.<br/><br/>The remiges are blackish, and the tail usually has some 3&ndash;4 wide blackish bands, too. Very light males only have faint and narrow medium-grey bands, while in the darkest birds the bands are very wide, so that the tail appears to have narrow lighter bands instead. In all of them, however, the tail tip is black with a narrow white band at the very end, a pattern possibly plesiomorphic for all falcons. Altogether, the tail pattern is quite distinct though, resembling only that of the aplomado falcon (<em>F. berigora</em>) and (in light merlins) some typical kestrels. The eye and beak are dark, the latter with a yellow cere. The feet are also yellow, with black claws.<br/><br/>Light American males may resemble the American kestrel (<em>F. sparverius</em>, not a typical kestrel), but merlin males have a grey back and tail rather than the reddish-brown of the kestrels. Light European males can be distinguished from kestrels by their mainly brown wings. In the north of South Asia, wintering males may be confused with the red-necked falcon (<em>F. chicquera</em>) if they fly away from the observer and the head (red on top in <em>F. chicquera</em>) and underside (finely barred with black in <em>F. chicquera</em>) are not visible.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>peregrine falcon</strong> (<em>Falco peregrinus</em>), also known as the <strong>peregrine</strong>, and historically as the <strong>duck hawk</strong> in North America, is a widespread bird of prey in the family Falconidae. A large, crow-sized falcon, it has a blue-grey back, barred white underparts, and a black head. As is typical of bird-eating raptors, peregrine falcons are sexually dimorphic, with females being considerably larger than males. The peregrine is renowned for its speed, reaching over 320&nbsp;km/h (200&nbsp;mph) during its characteristic hunting stoop (high speed dive), making it the fastest member of the animal kingdom. According to a National Geographic TV programme, the highest measured speed of a peregrine falcon is 389&nbsp;km/h (242&nbsp;mph).<br/><br/>The peregrine's breeding range includes land regions from the Arctic tundra to the tropics. It can be found nearly everywhere on Earth, except extreme polar regions, very high mountains, and most tropical rainforests; the only major ice-free landmass from which it is entirely absent is New Zealand. This makes it the world's most widespread raptor, and one of the most widely found bird species. In fact, the only land-based bird species found over a larger geographic area is not always naturally occurring, but one widely introduced by humans, the rock pigeon, which in turn now supports many peregrine populations as a prey species. The peregrine is a highly successful example of urban wildlife in much of its range, taking advantage of tall buildings as nest sites and an abundance of prey such as pigeons and ducks. Both the English and scientific names of this species mean \"wandering falcon,\" referring to the migratory habits of many northern populations. Experts recognize 17 to 19 subspecies, which vary in appearance and range; disagreement exists over whether the distinctive Barbary falcon is represented by two subspecies of <em>Falco peregrinus,</em> or is a separate species, <em>F. pelegrinoides.</em> The two species' divergence is relatively recent, during the time of the last ice age, therefore the genetic differential between them (and also the difference in their appearance) is relatively small. They are only about 0.6&ndash;0.8% genetically differentiated.<br/><br/>While its diet consists almost exclusively of medium-sized birds, the peregrine will occasionally hunt small mammals, small reptiles, or even insects. Reaching sexual maturity at one year, it mates for life and nests in a scrape, normally on cliff edges or, in recent times, on tall human-made structures. The peregrine falcon became an endangered species in many areas because of the widespread use of certain pesticides, especially DDT. Since the ban on DDT from the early 1970s, populations have recovered, supported by large-scale protection of nesting places and releases to the wild.<br/><br/>The peregrine falcon is a well respected falconry bird due to its strong hunting ability, high trainability, versatility, and in recent years availability via captive breeding. It is effective on most game bird species from small to large.<br/><br/>The peregrine falcon has a body length of 34&nbsp;to 58&nbsp;cm (13&ndash;23&nbsp;in) and a wingspan from 74&nbsp;to 120&nbsp;cm (29&ndash;47&nbsp;in). The male and female have similar markings and plumage, but as in many birds of prey the peregrine falcon displays marked sexual dimorphism in size, with the female measuring up to 30% larger than the male. Males weigh 330&nbsp;to 1,000&nbsp;g (0.73&ndash;2.20&nbsp;lb) and the noticeably larger females weigh 700&nbsp;to 1,500&nbsp;g (1.5&ndash;3.3&nbsp;lb). In most subspecies, males weigh less than 700&nbsp;g (1.5&nbsp;lb) and females weigh more than 800&nbsp;g (1.8&nbsp;lb), with cases of females weighing about 50% more than their male breeding mates not uncommon. The standard linear measurements of peregrines are: the wing chord measures 26.5&nbsp;to 39&nbsp;cm (10.4&ndash;15.4&nbsp;in), the tail measures 13&nbsp;to 19&nbsp;cm (5.1&ndash;7.5&nbsp;in) and the tarsus measures 4.5&nbsp;to 5.6&nbsp;cm (1.8&ndash;2.2&nbsp;in).<br/><br/>The back and the long pointed wings of the adult are usually bluish black to slate grey with indistinct darker barring (see \"Subspecies\" below); the wingtips are black. The white to rusty underparts are barred with thin clean bands of dark brown or black. The tail, coloured like the back but with thin clean bars, is long, narrow, and rounded at the end with a black tip and a white band at the very end. The top of the head and a \"moustache\" along the cheeks are black, contrasting sharply with the pale sides of the neck and white throat. The cere is yellow, as are the feet, and the beak and claws are black. The upper beak is notched near the tip, an adaptation which enables falcons to kill prey by severing the spinal column at the neck. The immature bird is much browner with streaked, rather than barred, underparts, and has a pale bluish cere and orbital ring.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Within the great grey shrike species itself, there are two subspecies. Males and females are similar in plumage, pearly grey above with a black eye-mask and white underparts.<br/><br/>Breeding takes place generally north of 50&deg; northern latitude in northern Europe and Asia. Most populations migrate south in winter to temperate regions. The great grey shrike is carnivorous, with rodents making up over half its diet.<br/><br/><b>Description</b> <br/><br/>An adult great grey shrike is a medium-sized passerine about as large as a big thrush, measuring from 22 to 26&nbsp;cm (8.7 to 10.2&nbsp;in) long. It typically weighs around 60 to 70&nbsp;g (2.1 to 2.5&nbsp;oz), although some subspecies are noticeably smaller or larger, and even in the nominate subspecies adult weights between 48 and 81&nbsp;g (1.7 and 2.9&nbsp;oz) are recorded. The wings are around 11.4&nbsp;cm (4.5&nbsp;in) and the tail around 10.9&nbsp;cm (4.3&nbsp;in) long in the nominate subspecies, its bill measures about 23&nbsp;mm (0.91&nbsp;in) from tip to skull, and the tarsometatarsus part of its \"legs\" (actually feet) is around 27.4&nbsp;mm (1.08&nbsp;in) long. Wingspan can range from 30 to 36&nbsp;cm (12 to 14&nbsp;in).<br/><br/>The general colour of the upperparts is pearl grey, tinged brownish towards the east of its Eurasian range. The cheeks and chin as well as a thin and often hard-to-see stripe above the eye are white, and a deep black mask extends from the beak through the eye to the ear coverts; the area immediately above the beak is grey. The scapulars (shoulder feathers) are white, and the wings are black with a white bar made up by the bases of the primary remiges, continuing slightly offset onto the bases of the secondary remiges in some regions. The tail is black, long, and pointed at the tip; the outer rectrices have white outer vanes. The underparts are white, slightly tinged with grey in most subspecies. In particular the breast is usually darker and sometimes browner than the rest of the light underside, and may appear as an indistinct band between the lighter belly and white throat. In the subspecies around the North Pacific in particular and in females elsewhere too, there may be faint brownish bars on the breast. The bill is large and hooked at the tip and coloured nearly black, but pale at the base of the under mandible (though the extent varies seasonally). The legs and feet are blackish.<br/><br/>Males and females are about the same size, and do not differ conspicuously in appearance except by direct comparison. In the female the underparts are greyer and are usually visibly barred greyish-brown, and the white wing and tail markings are characteristically less in extent (though this is rarely clearly visible except in flight). Fledged young birds are heavily tinged greyish-brown all over, with barring on the upperside and indistinct buffy-white markings. The tips of the tertiary remiges and the wing coverts are also buffy, with a black band in the latter. In the North American subspecies <em>borealis</em>, the fledglings are tinged quite brown indeed on upperside and wings, and have sharp and dark underside bars. In Eurasia, fledglings moult into a female-like plumage with the tertiary bars usually remaining in autumn. Across its range, the young acquire the adult plumage in their first spring.<br/><br/>The male's song consists of short pleasant warbling strophes, interspersed with fluid whistles. The individual phrases may go like <em>tu-tu-krr-pree-pree</em> or <em>trr-turit trr-turit...</em>. To announce that it has become aware of someone straying into its territory &ndash; be it a female or male of its species or a large mammal &ndash; it gives long shrill raspy whistles like <em>trrii(u)</em> or <em>(t')kwiiet</em>. To announce to females, it often mixes these whistles with a strophe of song. A softer whistle goes like <em>tr&uuml;&uuml;(t)</em>. These whistles are also used in duets between mates in winter and neighbours in the breeding season. Various contact calls have been described as <em>chlie(p)</em>, <em>gihrrr</em>, <em>kw&auml;</em> or <em>wuut</em>. These are frequently heard during courtship, interspersed with song phrases as the harsh whistles are in pre-courtship. The song becomes softer and more warbling as the male shows the female around his territory, and at potential nest sites the male gives a lively chatter containing fluting <em>tli-tli</em>, <em>prrr</em> trills and <em>kwiw...p&uuml;h</em> calls.<br/><br/>When disturbed, its alarm note is a harsh jay-like <em>k(w)eee</em>, <em>greee</em> or <em>jaaa</em>, often repeated twice. The more excited the birds become, the higher and faster the calls get, via <em>chek-chek-chek</em> to a rattle <em>trr-trr-trr</em> or an explosive <em>aak-aak-aak</em>. A bird of prey alert is given with a whistle <em>breezeek</em>. <em>Knuk</em> calls are given by adults confronted with a potential threat to their young. To beg for food &ndash; young to adults or pairmembers to each other &ndash;, rows of <em>waik</em> calls are given. This species sometimes tries to attract small songbirds by mimicking their calls, so it may attempt to catch them for food.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>woodchat shrike</strong> (<em>Lanius senator</em>) is a member of the shrike family Laniidae. The genus name, <em>Lanius</em>, is derived from the Latin word for \"butcher\", and some shrikes are also known as \"butcher birds\" because of their feeding habits. The specific <em>senator</em> is Latin for \"senator\", so-named because its chestnut cap recalled the colour of the stripe on the toga of a Roman senator. The common name \"Woodchat\" is an Anglicisation of German <em>waldkatze</em>, literally \"woodcat\", and \"shrike\" is from Old English <em>scr&iacute;c</em>, \"shriek\", referring to the shrill call.<br/><br/>The woodchat shrike breeds in southern Europe, the Middle East and northwest Africa, and winters in tropical Africa. It breeds in open cultivated country, preferably with orchard trees and some bare or sandy ground.<br/><br/>The male is a striking bird with black and white upper parts, a chestnut crown and pure white underparts. The race <em>L. s. badius</em> of the western Mediterranean lacks the large white wing patches. In the female and young birds, the upperparts are brown and white and vermiculated. Underparts are buff and also vermiculated.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"species": "pica",
			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian magpie</strong> or <strong>common magpie</strong> (<em>Pica pica</em>) is a resident breeding bird throughout Europe, much of Asia and the Maghreb. It is one of several birds in the crow family designated magpies, and belongs to the Holarctic radiation of \"monochrome\" magpies. In Europe, \"magpie\" is used by English speakers as a synonym for the European magpie: the only other magpie in Europe is the Iberian magpie (<em>Cyanopica cooki</em>), which is limited to the Iberian peninsula.<br/><br/>The Eurasian magpie is one of the most intelligent birds, and it is believed to be one of the most intelligent of all non-human animals. The expansion of its nidopallium is approximately the same in its relative size as the brain of chimpanzees, orangutans and humans.<br/><br/>The adult male of the nominate subspecies, <em>P.&nbsp;p.&nbsp;pica</em>, is 44&ndash;46&nbsp;cm (17&ndash;18&nbsp;in) in length, of which more than half is the tail. The wingspan is 52&ndash;62&nbsp;cm (20&ndash;24&nbsp;in). The head, neck and breast are glossy black with a metallic green and violet sheen; the belly and scapulars (shoulder feathers) are pure white; the wings are black glossed with green or purple, and the primaries have white inner webs, conspicuous when the wing is open. The graduated tail is black, glossed with green and reddish purple. The legs and bill are black; the iris is dark brown. The plumage of the sexes is similar but females are slightly smaller. The tail feathers of both sexes are quite long, about 12-28 cm long. Males of the nominate subspecies weigh 210&ndash;272&nbsp;g (7.4&ndash;9.6&nbsp;oz) while females weigh 182&ndash;214&nbsp;g (6.4&ndash;7.5&nbsp;oz). The young resemble the adults, but are at first without much of the gloss on the sooty plumage. The young have the malar region pink, and somewhat clear eyes. The tail is much shorter than the adults.<br/><br/>The subspecies differ in their size, the amount of white on their plumage and the colour of the gloss on their black feathers. The northwest African race <em>P. p. mauritanica</em> differs from the nominate subspecies in having a patch of blue bare skin behind the eye, no white patch on the rump, and a longer tail. The southwest Arabian race <em>P. p. asirensis</em> differs in having more black in the plumage with a narrower white scapular patch, no white rump, and smaller white areas on the primaries. The Asian race <em>P. p. bactriana</em> has more extensive white on the primaries and a prominent white rump.<br/><br/>Adults undergo an annual complete moult after breeding. Moult begins in June or July and ends in September or October. The primary flight feathers are replaced over a period of three months. Juvenile birds undergo a partial moult beginning about one month later than the adult birds in which their body feathers are replaced but not those of the wings or the tail.<br/><br/>Eurasian magpies have a well-known call. It is a choking chatter \"chac-chac\" or a repetitive \"chac-chac-chac-chac\". The young also emit the previous call, although they also emit an acute call similar to a \"Uik Uik\", which may resemble the barking of a small dog. Both adults and young can emit a kind of hiss barely noticeable from afar<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Commonname": "Common Raven",
			"Genus": "Corvus",
			"species": "corax",
			"Description": "The <strong>common raven</strong> (<em>Corvus corax</em>), also known as the <strong>northern raven</strong>, is a large all-black passerine bird. Found across the Northern Hemisphere, it is the most widely distributed of all corvids. There are at least eight subspecies with little variation in appearance, although recent research has demonstrated significant genetic differences among populations from various regions. It is one of the two largest corvids, alongside the thick-billed raven, and is possibly the heaviest passerine bird; at maturity, the common raven averages 63 centimetres (25 inches) in length and 1.2 kilograms (2.6 pounds) in mass. Common ravens can live up to 21 years in the wild, a lifespan surpassed among passerines by only a few Australasian species such as the satin bowerbird and probably the lyrebirds. Young birds may travel in flocks but later mate for life, with each mated pair defending a territory.<br/><br/>Common ravens have coexisted with humans for thousands of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; they are extremely versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.<br/><br/>Some notable feats of problem-solving provide evidence that the common raven is unusually intelligent. Over the centuries, it has been the subject of mythology, folklore, art, and literature. In many cultures, including the indigenous cultures of Scandinavia, ancient Ireland and Wales, Bhutan, the northwest coast of North America, and Siberia and northeast Asia, the common raven has been revered as a spiritual figure or god.<br/><br/>A mature common raven ranges between 54 and 67&nbsp;cm (21\" and 26\") long, with a wingspan of 115 to 130&nbsp;cm (45&ndash;51\"). Recorded weights range from 0.69 to 2&nbsp;kg (1.5 to 4.4&nbsp;lb), thus making the common raven one of the heaviest passerines. Birds from colder regions such as the Himalayas and Greenland are generally larger with slightly larger bills, while those from warmer regions are smaller with proportionally smaller bills. Representative of the size variation in the species, ravens from California weighed an average of 784&nbsp;g (1.728&nbsp;lb), those from Alaska weighed an average of 1,135&nbsp;g (2.502&nbsp;lb) and those from Nova Scotia weighed an average of 1,230&nbsp;g (2.71&nbsp;lb). The bill is large and slightly curved, with a culmen length of 5.7 to 8.5&nbsp;cm (2.2 to 3.3&nbsp;in), easily one of the largest bills amongst passerines (perhaps only the thick-billed raven has a noticeably larger bill). It has a longish, strongly graduated tail, at 20 to 26.3&nbsp;cm (7.9 to 10.4&nbsp;in), and mostly black iridescent plumage, and a dark brown iris. The throat feathers are elongated and pointed and the bases of the neck feathers are pale brownish-grey. The legs and feet are good-sized, with a tarsus length of 6 to 7.2&nbsp;cm (2.4 to 2.8&nbsp;in). Juvenile plumage is similar but duller with a blue-grey iris.<br/><br/>Apart from its greater size, the common raven differs from its cousins, the crows, by having a larger and heavier black beak, shaggy feathers around the throat and above the beak, and a wedge-shaped tail. Flying ravens are distinguished from crows by their tail shape, larger wing area, and more stable soaring style, which generally involves less wing flapping. Despite their bulk, ravens are easily as agile in flight as their smaller cousins. In flight the feathers produce a creaking sound that has been likened to the rustle of silk. The voice of ravens is also quite distinct, its usual call being a deep croak of a much more sonorous quality than a crow's call. In North America, the Chihuahuan raven (<em>C. cryptoleucus</em>) is fairly similar to the relatively small common ravens of the American southwest and is best distinguished by the still relatively smaller size of its bill, beard and body and relatively longer tail. All-black carrion crow (<em>C. corone</em>) in Europe may suggest a raven due to their largish bill but are still distinctly smaller and have the wing and tail shapes typical of crows.<br/><br/>In the Faroe Islands a now extinct colour-morph of this species existed, known as the pied raven.<br/><br/>White ravens are occasionally found in the wild. Birds in British Columbia lack the pink eyes of an albino, and are instead leucistic, a condition where an animal lacks any of several different types of pigment, not simply melanin.Common ravens have a wide range of vocalizations which are of interest to ornithologists. Gwinner carried out important studies in the early 1960s, recording and photographing his findings in great detail. Fifteen to 30 categories of vocalization have been recorded for this species, most of which are used for social interaction. Calls recorded include alarm calls, chase calls, and flight calls. The species has a distinctive, deep, resonant <em>prruk-prruk-prruk</em> call, which to experienced listeners is unlike that of any other corvid. Its very wide and complex vocabulary includes a high, knocking <em>toc-toc-toc</em>, a dry, grating <em>kraa</em>, a low guttural rattle and some calls of an almost musical nature.<br/><br/>Like other corvids, ravens can mimic sounds from their environment, including human speech. Non-vocal sounds produced by the common raven include wing whistles and bill snapping. Clapping or clicking has been observed more often in females than in males. If a member of a pair is lost, its mate reproduces the calls of its lost partner to encourage its return.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Passer",
			"species": "domesticus",
			"Description": "The <strong>house sparrow</strong> (<em>Passer domesticus</em>) is a bird of the sparrow family Passeridae, found in most parts of the world. A small bird, it has a typical length of 16&nbsp;cm (6.3&nbsp;in) and a mass of 24&ndash;39.5&nbsp;g (0.85&ndash;1.39&nbsp;oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25&nbsp;species in the genus <em>Passer</em>, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and much of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.<br/><br/>The house sparrow is strongly associated with human habitations, and can live in urban or rural settings. Though found in widely varied habitats and climates, it typically avoids extensive woodlands, grasslands, and deserts away from human development. It feeds mostly on the seeds of grains and weeds, but it is an opportunistic eater and commonly eats insects and many other foods. Its predators include domestic cats, hawks, owls, and many other predatory birds and mammals.<br/><br/>Because of its numbers, ubiquity, and association with human settlements, the house sparrow is culturally prominent. It is extensively, and usually unsuccessfully, persecuted as an agricultural pest. It has also often been kept as a pet, as well as being a food item and a symbol of lust, sexual potency, commonness, and vulgarity. Though it is widespread and abundant, its numbers have declined in some areas. The animal's conservation status is listed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.<br/><b>Measurements and shape</b> <br/><br/>The house sparrow is typically about 16&nbsp;cm (6.3&nbsp;in) long, ranging from 14 to 18&nbsp;cm (5.5 to 7.1&nbsp;in). It is a compact bird with a full chest and a large, rounded head. Its bill is stout and conical with a culmen length of 1.1&ndash;1.5&nbsp;cm (0.43&ndash;0.59&nbsp;in), strongly built as an adaptation for eating seeds. Its tail is short, at 5.2&ndash;6.5&nbsp;cm (2.0&ndash;2.6&nbsp;in) long. The wing chord is 6.7&ndash;8.9&nbsp;cm (2.6&ndash;3.5&nbsp;in), and the tarsus is 1.6&ndash;2.5&nbsp;cm (0.63&ndash;0.98&nbsp;in). In mass, the house sparrow ranges from 24 to 39.5&nbsp;g (0.85 to 1.39&nbsp;oz). Females usually are slightly smaller than males. The median mass on the European continent for both sexes is about 30&nbsp;g (1.1&nbsp;oz), and in more southerly subspecies is around 26&nbsp;g (0.92&nbsp;oz). Younger birds are smaller, males are larger during the winter, and females are larger during the breeding season. Birds at higher latitudes, colder climates, and sometimes higher altitudes are larger (under Bergmann's rule), both between and within subspecies.<br/><b>Plumage</b> <br/><br/>The plumage of the house sparrow is mostly different shades of grey and brown. The sexes exhibit strong dimorphism: the female is mostly buffish above and below, while the male has boldly coloured head markings, a reddish back, and grey underparts. The male has a dark grey crown from the top of its bill to its back, and chestnut brown flanking its crown on the sides of its head. It has black around its bill, on its throat, and on the spaces between its bill and eyes (lores). It has a small white stripe between the lores and crown and small white spots immediately behind the eyes (postoculars), with black patches below and above them. The underparts are pale grey or white, as are the cheeks, ear coverts, and stripes at the base of the head. The upper back and mantle are a warm brown, with broad black streaks, while the lower back, rump and uppertail coverts are greyish brown.<br/><br/>The male is duller in fresh nonbreeding plumage, with whitish tips on many feathers. Wear and preening expose many of the bright brown and black markings, including most of the black throat and chest patch, called the \"bib\" or \"badge\". The badge is variable in width and general size, and may signal social status or fitness. This hypothesis has led to a \"veritable 'cottage industry'\" of studies, which have only conclusively shown that patches increase in size with age. The male's bill is black in the breeding season and horn (dark grey) during the rest of the year.<br/><br/>The female has no black markings or grey crown. Its upperparts and head are brown with darker streaks around the mantle and a distinct pale supercilium. Its underparts are pale grey-brown. The female's bill is brownish-grey and becomes darker in breeding plumage approaching the black of the male's bill.<br/><br/>Juveniles are similar to the adult female, but deeper brown below and paler above, with paler and less defined supercilia. Juveniles have broader buff feather edges, and tend to have looser, scruffier plumage, like moulting adults. Juvenile males tend to have darker throats and white postoculars like adult males, while juvenile females tend to have white throats. However, juveniles cannot be reliably sexed by plumage: some juvenile males lack any markings of the adult male, and some juvenile females have male features. The bills of young birds are light yellow to straw, paler than the female's bill. Immature males have paler versions of the adult male's markings, which can be very indistinct in fresh plumage. By their first breeding season, young birds generally are indistinguishable from other adults, though they may still be paler during their first year.<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>Most house sparrow vocalisations are variations on its short and incessant chirping call. Transcribed as <em>chirrup</em>, <em>tschilp</em>, or <em>philip</em>, this note is made as a contact call by flocking or resting birds, or by males to proclaim nest ownership and invite pairing. In the breeding season, the male gives this call repetitively, with emphasis and speed, but not much rhythm, forming what is described either as a song or an \"ecstatic call\" similar to a song. Young birds also give a true song, especially in captivity, a warbling similar to that of the European greenfinch.<br/><br/>Aggressive males give a trilled version of their call, transcribed as \"chur-<em>chur-r-r-it-it-it-it</em>\". This call is also used by females in the breeding season, to establish dominance over males while displacing them to feed young or incubate eggs. House sparrows give a nasal alarm call, the basic sound of which is transcribed as <em>quer</em>, and a shrill <em>chree</em> call in great distress. Another vocalisation is the \"appeasement call\", a soft <em>quee</em> given to inhibit aggression, usually given between birds of a mated pair. These vocalisations are not unique to the house sparrow, but are shared, with small variations, by all sparrows.<br/><b>Variation</b> <br/><br/>Some variation is seen in the 12 subspecies of house sparrows, which are divided into two groups, the Oriental <em>P. d. indicus</em> group, and the Palaearctic <em>P. d. domesticus</em> group. Birds of the <em>P. d. domesticus</em> group have grey cheeks, while <em>P. d. indicus</em> group birds have white cheeks, as well as bright colouration on the crown, a smaller bill, and a longer black bib. The subspecies <em>P. d. tingitanus</em> differs little from the nominate subspecies, except in the worn breeding plumage of the male, in which the head is speckled with black and underparts are paler. <em>P. d. balearoibericus</em> is slightly paler than the nominate, but darker than <em>P. d. bibilicus</em>. <em>P. d. bibilicus</em> is paler than most subspecies, but has the grey cheeks of <em>P. d. domesticus</em> group birds. The similar <em>P. d. persicus</em> is paler and smaller, and <em>P. d. niloticus</em> is nearly identical but smaller. Of the less widespread <em>P. d. indicus</em> group subspecies, <em>P. d. hyrcanus</em> is larger than <em>P. d. indicus</em>, <em>P. d. hufufae</em> is paler, <em>P. d. bactrianus</em> is larger and paler, and <em>P. d. parkini</em> is larger and darker with more black on the breast than any other subspecies.<br/><b>Identification</b> <br/><br/>The house sparrow can be confused with a number of other seed-eating birds, especially its relatives in the genus <em>Passer</em>. Many of these relatives are smaller, with an appearance that is neater or \"cuter\", as with the Dead Sea sparrow. The dull-coloured female can often not be distinguished from other females, and is nearly identical to those of the Spanish and Italian sparrows. The Eurasian tree sparrow is smaller and more slender with a chestnut crown and a black patch on each cheek. The male Spanish sparrow and Italian sparrow are distinguished by their chestnut crowns. The Sind sparrow is very similar but smaller, with less black on the male's throat and a distinct pale supercilium on the female.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian tree sparrow</strong> (<em>Passer montanus</em>) is a passerine bird in the sparrow family with a rich chestnut crown and nape, and a black patch on each pure white cheek. The sexes are similarly plumaged, and young birds are a duller version of the adult. This sparrow breeds over most of temperate Eurasia and Southeast Asia, where it is known as the <strong>tree sparrow</strong>, and it has been introduced elsewhere including the United States, where it is known as the Eurasian tree sparrow or <strong>German sparrow</strong> to differentiate it from the native unrelated American tree sparrow. Although several subspecies are recognised, the appearance of this bird varies little across its extensive range.<br/><br/>The Eurasian tree sparrow's untidy nest is built in a natural cavity, a hole in a building or the large nest of a European magpie or white stork. The typical clutch is five or six eggs which hatch in under two weeks. This sparrow feeds mainly on seeds, but invertebrates are also consumed, particularly during the breeding season. As with other small birds, infection by parasites and diseases, and predation by birds of prey take their toll, and the typical life span is about two years.<br/><br/>The Eurasian tree sparrow is widespread in the towns and cities of eastern Asia, but in Europe it is a bird of lightly wooded open countryside, with the house sparrow breeding in the more urban areas. The Eurasian tree sparrow's extensive range and large population ensure that it is not endangered globally, but there have been large declines in western European populations, in part due to changes in farming practices involving increased use of herbicides and loss of winter stubble fields. In eastern Asia and western Australia, this species is sometimes viewed as a pest, although it is also widely celebrated in oriental art.<br/><br/>The Eurasian tree sparrow is 12.5&ndash;14&nbsp;cm (5&ndash;5&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of about 21&nbsp;cm (8.3&nbsp;in) and a weight of 24&nbsp;g (0.85&nbsp;oz), making it roughly 10% smaller than the house sparrow. The adult's crown and nape are rich chestnut, and there is a kidney-shaped black ear patch on each pure white cheek; the chin, throat, and the area between the bill and throat are black. The upperparts are light brown, streaked with black, and the brown wings have two distinct narrow white bars. The legs are pale brown, and the bill is lead-blue in summer, becoming almost black in winter.<br/><br/>This sparrow is distinctive even within its genus in that it has no plumage differences between the sexes; the juvenile also resembles the adult, although the colours tend to be duller. Its contrasting face pattern makes this species easily identifiable in all plumages; the smaller size and brown, not grey, crown are additional differences from the male house sparrow. Adult and juvenile Eurasian tree sparrows undergo a slow complete moult in the autumn, and show an increase in body mass despite a reduction in stored fat. The change in mass is due to an increase in blood volume to support active feather growth, and a generally higher water content in the body.<br/><br/>The Eurasian tree sparrow has no true song, but its vocalisations include an excited series of <em>tschip</em> calls given by unpaired or courting males. Other monosyllabic chirps are used in social contacts, and the flight call is a harsh <em>teck</em>. A study comparing the vocalisations of the introduced Missouri population with those of birds from Germany showed that the US birds had fewer shared syllable types (memes) and more structure within the population than the European sparrows. This may have resulted from the small size of the founding North American population and a consequent loss of genetic diversity.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is migratory over most of its range, wintering in Southern Europe, North Africa and Southwestern Asia, but is resident year-round in Western Europe. However, even here, many birds move to the coast or lowlands in winter.<br/><br/>This is a widespread and often abundant small pipit, 14.5&ndash;15 cm long and 15&ndash;22 g weight. It is an undistinguished looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and buff below, with darker streaking on most of its plumage; the tail is brown, with narrow white side edges. It has a thin bill and pale pinkish-yellow legs; the hind claw is notably long, longer than the rest of the hind toe. The call is a weak <em>tsi-tsi</em>. The simple repetitive song is given in a short song flight. Birds breeding in Ireland and western Scotland are slightly darker coloured than those in other areas, and are often distinguished as the subspecies <em>Anthus pratensis whistleri</em>, though it intergrades clinally with nominate <em>Anthus pratensis pratensis</em> found in the rest of the species' range.<br/><br/>It is similar to the red-throated pipit <em>Anthus cervinus</em>, which is more heavily streaked and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the tree pipit <em>Anthus trivialis</em>, which is slightly larger, less heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw.

			"Genus": "Anthus",
			"species": "spinoletta",
			"Description": "The <strong>water pipit</strong> (<em>Anthus spinoletta</em>) is a small passerine bird which breeds in the mountains of Southern Europe and Southern Asia eastwards to China. It is a short-distance migrant; many birds move to lower altitudes or wet open lowlands in winter.<br/><br/>The water pipit in breeding plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium (\"eyebrow\"), and the outer tail feathers are white. In winter, the head is grey-brown, the supercilium is duller, the upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, streaked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks. There are only minor differences between the three subspecies, the sexes are almost identical, and young birds resemble adults. The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about six repetitions of a different short note.<br/><br/>Water pipits construct a cup-like nest on the ground under vegetation or in cliff crevices and lay four to six speckled grey-ish white eggs, which hatch in about two weeks with a further 14&ndash;15&nbsp;days to fledging. Although pipits occasionally catch insects in flight, they feed mainly on small invertebrates picked off the ground or vegetation, and also some plant material.<br/><br/>The water pipit may be hunted by birds of prey, infested by parasites such as fleas, or act as an involuntary host to the common cuckoo, but overall its population is large and stable, and it is therefore evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).<br/><br/>The water pipit is 15&ndash;17 centimetres (5.9&ndash;6.7&nbsp;in) long and weighs 18.7&ndash;23 grams (0.66&ndash;0.81&nbsp;oz). The adult of the nominate race in spring plumage has greyish-brown upperparts, weakly streaked with darker brown, and pale pink-buff underparts fading to whitish on the lower belly. There may be some faint streaking on the breast and flanks. The head is grey with a broad white supercilium. The outer tail feathers are white, and the legs, bill and iris are dark brown or blackish. In non-breeding plumage, the head is grey-brown and the supercilium is less distinct. The upperparts are more streaked, and the underparts are white, marked lightly with brown on the breast and flanks.<br/><br/>The sexes are similar although the female has, on average, a greyer head. Young birds resembles the non-breeding adult, but are browner and more streaked above with prominent streaking on the underparts. <em>A. s. coutellii</em> is smaller than the nominate subspecies and the white of the outer tail feathers has a hint of grey. It is paler and more heavily streaked above, and in summer plumage the underparts' colour covers a larger area and has a rusty tint. <em>A. s. blakistoni</em> is large, pale and less strongly streaked.<br/><br/>The water pipit has a complete moult between July and September, although there is considerable individual variation in timing. There is a partial pre-breeding moult, mainly between January and March, but with much variability in timing. This moult typically involves replacing the head, body and some wing feathers, but the extent is again variable. Very occasionally, females may moult into what looks like non-breeding plumage, rather than the expected brighter garb. The chicks start to gain juvenile plumage as soon as a month after hatching, and most have completed the transition to near-adult appearance by September. The first pre-breeding moult is similar to that of the adult, but may be less complete or even absent.<br/><br/>The water pipit is closely related to the Eurasian rock pipit and the meadow pipit, and is rather similar to both in appearance. Compared to the meadow pipit, the water pipit is longer-winged and longer-tailed than its relative, and has much paler underparts. It has dark, rather than pinkish-red, legs. The water pipit in winter plumage is also confusable with the Eurasian rock pipit, but has a strong supercilium, greyer upperparts, and white, not grey, outer tail feathers; it is also typically much warier. The habitats used by Eurasian rock and water pipits are completely separate in the breeding season, and there is little overlap even when birds are not nesting. There is also little mixing with breeding meadow pipits, although since 1960 some overlapping territories have been found where the species coexist.<br/><br/>The Eurasian rock pipit's subspecies <em>Anthus petrosus littoralis</em> in summer plumage is particularly close in outward appearance to the water pipit. The rock pipit normally has a bluer tint to the head, streaking on the breast and flanks, and buff outer tail feathers, and the songs are also different. The species mostly occupy different habitat types even when they occur in the same general area.<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>The water pipit's song is delivered from a perch or in flight, and consists of four or five blocks, each consisting of about half a dozen repetitions of a different short note. In comparison, the Eurasian rock pipit's song is a sequence of about twenty tinkling <em>cheepa</em> notes followed by a rising series of thin <em>gee</em> calls, and finishing with a short trill. The call of the water pipit is a single or double sharp &ldquo;dzip&rdquo; or similar, slightly harsher than soft <em>sip sip sip</em> of the meadow pipit or the shrill <em>pseep</em> of the Eurasian rock pipit. The short, thin <em>fist</em> flight call is intermediate between the <em>sip</em> of the meadow pipit and the rock pipit's <em>feest</em>. The differences between the calls of the pipit species are very subtle, and not diagnostic in the absence of other evidence. The flight call of the subspecies <em>A. s. coutellii</em> is shorter and more buzzing than that of the nominate race.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a long-distance migrant moving to open lowlands in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is a rare but regular vagrant to western Europe.<br/><br/>The genus name <em>Anthus</em> is the Latin name for a small bird of grasslands. The English name and <em>richardi</em> are for the French naturalist Charles Richard (1745&ndash;1835), director of postal services at Lun&eacute;ville and friend of Francois Levaillant.<br/><br/>It belongs to the pipit genus <em>Anthus</em> in the family Motacillidae. It was formerly lumped together with the Australasian, African, mountain and paddyfield pipits in a single species: Richard's pipit, <em>Anthus novaeseelandiae</em>. These pipits are now commonly considered to be separate species although the African and paddyfield pipits are sometimes treated as part of <em>A. richardi</em>.<br/><br/>This is a large pipit, 17&ndash;20&nbsp;cm in length, with a weight of 25&ndash;36&nbsp;g and a wingspan of 29 to 33&nbsp;cm. It is a slender bird which often stands very upright. It has long yellow-brown legs, a long tail with white outer-feathers and a long dark bill with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. The hindclaw is long and fairly straight. It is an undistinguished-looking species on the ground, mainly brown above and pale below. There are dark streaks on the upperparts and breast while the belly and flanks are plain. The face is strongly marked with pale lores and supercilium and dark eyestripe, moustachial stripe and malar stripe. There are two wingbars formed by pale tips to the wing-coverts.<br/><br/>There is some variation between the different subspecies. <em>A. r. sinensis</em> is slightly smaller than the nominate race with less streaking above. <em>A. r. centralasiae</em> is larger with more sand-coloured upperparts. <em>A. r. dauricus</em> has more streaking above.<br/><br/>Its flight is strong and undulating, and it gives a characteristic explosive \"shreep\" call, somewhat similar to the chirp of a house sparrow. The song is a repeated series of monotonous buzzy notes given in an undulating song-flight.<br/><br/>Some care must be taken to distinguish this from other large pipits which winter or are resident in the area, such as Blyth's pipit and paddyfield pipit. Blyth's pipit has a shorter bill, legs and tail, a shorter and more curved hindclaw, less white on the tail and more streaking on the upperparts. In adult birds, the median wing-coverts have blunt-ended dark centres whereas in Richard's pipit the dark centres become pointed towards the tip of the feather. The call of Blyth's pipit call is quieter and less harsh. Paddyfield pipit is smaller than Richard's pipit with a shorter bill and tail, less streaking on the breast and a quieter call.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>grey wagtail</strong> (<em>Motacilla cinerea</em>) is a member of the wagtail family, Motacillidae, measuring around 18&ndash;19&nbsp;cm overall length. The species looks somewhat similar to the yellow wagtail but has the yellow on its underside restricted to the throat and vent. Breeding males have a black throat. The species is widely distributed, with several populations breeding in Europe and Asia and migrating to tropical regions in Asia and Africa. The species is always associated with running water when breeding, although they may use man-made structures near streams for the nest. Outside the breeding season, they may also be seen around lakes, coasts and other watery habitats. Like other wagtails, they frequently wag their tail and fly low with undulations and they have a sharp call that is often given in flight.<br/><br/>This slim wagtail has a narrow white supercilium and a broken eye ring. The upperparts are grey and the yellow vent contrasting with whitish underparts makes it distinctive. The breeding male has a black throat that is edged by whitish moustachial stripes. They forage singly or in pairs on meadows or on shallow water marshes. They also use rocks in water and will often perch on trees. They have a clear sharp call note and the song consists of trills.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>white wagtail</strong> (<em>Motacilla alba</em>) is a small passerine bird in the wagtail family Motacillidae, which also includes the pipits and longclaws. This species breeds in much of Europe and Asia and parts of north Africa. It is resident in the mildest parts of its range, but otherwise migrates to Africa. It has a toehold in Alaska as a scarce breeder. In Ireland and Great Britain the darker sub-species the <strong>pied wagtail</strong> (<em>M. a. yarrellii</em>) predominates.<br/><br/>The white wagtail is an insectivorous bird of open country, often near habitation and water. It prefers bare areas for feeding, where it can see and pursue its prey. In urban areas it has adapted to foraging on paved areas such as car parks. It nests in crevices in stone walls and similar natural and man-made structures.<br/><br/>The white wagtail is a slender bird, 16.5&ndash;19&nbsp;cm (6&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&ndash;7&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>2</sub>&nbsp;in) in length (East Asian subspecies are longer, measuring up to 21&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>4</sub>&nbsp;in), with the characteristic long, constantly wagging tail of its genus. Its average weight is 25&nbsp;g (0.88&nbsp;oz) and the maximum lifespan in the wild is c. 12 years. The nominate subspecies <em>Motacilla alba alba</em> is basically grey above and white below, with a white face, black cap and black throat.<br/><br/>There are a number of other subspecies, some of which may have arisen because of partial geographical isolation, such as the resident British form, the pied wagtail <em>M. a. yarrellii</em>, which now also breeds in adjacent areas of the neighbouring European mainland. The pied wagtail, named for naturalist William Yarrell, exchanges the grey colour of the nominate form with black (or very dark grey in females), but is otherwise identical in its behaviour. Other subspecies, the validity of some of which is questionable, differ in the colour of the wings, back, and head, or other features. Some races show sexual dimorphism during the breeding season. As many as six subspecies may be present in the wintering ground in India or Southeast Asia and here they can be difficult to distinguish.Phylogenetic studies using mtDNA suggest that some morphological features have evolved more than once, including the back and chin colour. Breeding <em>M. a. yarrellii</em> look much like the nominate race except for the black back, and <em>M. a. alboides</em> of the Himalayas differs from the Central Asian <em>M. a. personata</em> only by its black back. <em>M. a. personata</em> has been recorded breeding in the Siddar Valley of Kashmir of the Western Himalayas. It has also been noted that both back and chin change colour during the pre-basic moult; all black-throated subspecies develop white chins and throats in winter and some black-backed birds are grey-backed in winter.<br/><br/>The call of the white wagtail is a sharp <em>chisick</em>, slightly softer than the version given by the pied wagtail. The song is a pleasant twittering, more regular in white than pied, but with little territorial significance, since the male uses a series of contact calls to attract the female<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>common chaffinch</strong> (<em>Fringilla coelebs</em>), usually known simply as the <strong>chaffinch</strong>, is a common and widespread small passerine bird in the finch family. The male is brightly coloured with a blue-grey cap and rust-red underparts. The female is much duller in colouring, but both sexes have two contrasting white wing bars and white sides to the tail. The male bird has a strong voice and sings from exposed perches to attract a mate.<br/><br/>The chaffinch breeds in much of Europe, across Asia to Siberia and in northwest Africa. The female builds a nest with a deep cup in the fork of a tree. The clutch is typically four or five eggs, which hatch in about 13&nbsp;days. The chicks fledge in around 14&nbsp;days, but are fed by both adults for several weeks after leaving the nest. Outside the breeding season, chaffinches form flocks in open countryside and forage for seeds on the ground. During the breeding season, they forage on trees for invertebrates, especially caterpillars, and feed these to their young. They are partial migrants; birds breeding in warmer regions are sedentary, while those breeding in the colder northern areas of their range winter further south.<br/><br/>The eggs and nestlings of the chaffinch are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. Its large numbers and huge range mean that chaffinches are classed as of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.<br/><br/>chaffinch is about 14.5&nbsp;cm (5.7&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 24.5&ndash;28.5&nbsp;cm (9.6&ndash;11.2&nbsp;in) and a weight of 18&ndash;29&nbsp;g (0.63&ndash;1.02&nbsp;oz). The adult male of the nominate subspecies has a black forehead and a blue-grey crown, nape and upper mantle. The rump is a light olive-green; the lower mantle and scapulars form a brown saddle. The side of head, throat and breast are a dull rust-red merging to a pale creamy-pink on the belly. The central pair of tail feathers are dark grey with a black shaft streak. The rest of the tail is black apart from the two outer feathers on each side which have white wedges. Each wing has a contrasting white panel on the coverts and a buff-white bar on the secondaries and inner primaries. The flight feathers are black with white on the basal portions of the vanes. The secondaries and inner primaries have pale yellow fringes on the outer web whereas the outer primaries have a white outer edge.<br/><br/>After the autumn moult the tips of the new feathers have a buff fringe that adds a brown cast to the coloured plumage. The ends of the feathers wear away over the winter so that by the spring breeding season the underlying brighter colours are displayed. The eyes have dark brown irises and the legs are grey-brown. In winter the bill is a pale grey and slightly darker along the upper ridge or culmen, but in spring the bill becomes bluish-grey with a small black tip.<br/><br/>The male of the subspecies resident in the British Isles (<em>F. c. gengleri</em>) closely resembles the nominate subspecies but has a slightly darker mantle and underparts. The males of the two North Africa subspecies <em>F. c. africana</em> and <em>F. c. spodiogenys</em> have a blue-grey crown and nape that extends down to the sides of the head and neck, a black forehead and lore, a broken white eye-ring, a bright olive-green saddle and a pink-buff throat and breast. The males of <em>F. c. canariensis</em> and <em>F. c. palmae</em> in the Canary Islands have deep slate-blue upperparts and lack a contrasting mantle. Male chaffinches in Madeira (<em>F. c. maderensis</em>) and the Azores (<em>F. c. moreletti</em>) are similar in appearance to <em>F. c. canariensis</em> but have a bright green mantle.<br/><br/>The adult female is much duller in appearance than the male. The head and most of upperparts are shades of grey-brown. The underparts are paler. The lower back and rump are a dull olive green. The wings and tail are similar to those of the male. The juvenile resembles the female<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>The powerful song is well known, and it is possible that the <em>fink</em> or <em>vink</em> sounding call gives the finch family its English name. Males typically sing two or three different song types, and there are regional dialects too.<br/><br/>The acquisition by the young chaffinch of its song was the subject of an influential study by British ethologist William Thorpe. Thorpe determined that if the chaffinch is not exposed to the adult male's song during a certain critical period after hatching, it will never properly learn the song. He also found that in adult chaffinches, castration eliminates song, but injection of testosterone induces such birds to sing even in November, when they are normally silent<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a rare vagrant to the western islands of Alaska.<br/><br/>Deciduous or mixed woodland, including parkland, with large trees - especially hornbeam - is favoured for breeding. The hawfinch builds its nest in a bush or tree, and lays 2-7 eggs. The food is mainly seeds and fruit kernels, especially those of cherries, which it cracks with its powerful bill. This large finch species is usually seen in a pair or small group.<br/><br/>The 16.5&ndash;18&nbsp;cm long hawfinch is a bulky bull-headed bird, which appears very short-tailed in flight.

			"Description": "The <strong>European serin</strong>, or just <strong>serin</strong>, (<em>Serinus serinus</em>) is the smallest European species of the family of finches (Fringillidae) and is closely related to the canary. Its diet consists mainly of a combination of buds and seeds.<br/><br/>The European serin is a small short-tailed bird, 11&ndash;12&nbsp;cm in length. The upper parts are dark-streaked greyish green, with a yellow rump. The yellow breast and white belly are also heavily streaked. The male has a brighter yellow face and breast, yellow wing bars and yellow tail sides. The song of this bird is a buzzing trill, very familiar in Mediterranean countries.<br/><br/>It breeds across southern and central Europe and north Africa. Southern and Atlantic coast populations are largely resident, but the northern breeders migrate further south in Europe for the winter. Open woodland and cultivation, often with some conifers, is favoured for breeding. It builds its nest in a shrub or tree, laying 3&ndash;5 eggs. It forms flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches.<br/><br/>The food is mainly seeds, and, in the breeding season, insects. This small serin is an active and often conspicuous bird.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian siskin</strong> (<em>Spinus spinus</em>) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is also called the <strong>European siskin</strong>, <strong>common siskin</strong> or just <strong>siskin</strong>. Other (archaic) names include <em>black-headed goldfinch</em>, <em>barley bird</em> and <em>aberdevine</em>. It is very common throughout Europe and Asia. It is found in forested areas, both coniferous and mixed woodland where it feeds on seeds of all kinds, especially of alder and conifers.<br/><br/>It can be distinguished from other similar finches by the color of the plumage. The upper parts are greyish green and the under parts grey-streaked white. Its wings are black with a conspicuous yellow wing bar, and the tail is black with yellow sides. The male has a mainly yellow face and breast, with a neat black cap. Female and young birds have a greyish green head and no cap. It is a trusting, sociable and active bird. The song of this bird is a pleasant mix of twitters and trills. For these reasons it is often raised in captivity.<br/><br/>These birds have an unusual migration pattern as every few years in winter they migrate southwards in large numbers. The reasons for this behaviour are not known but may be related to climatic factors and above all the availability of food. In this way overwintering populations can thrive where food is abundant. This small finch is an acrobatic feeder, often hanging upside-down like a tit. It will visit garden bird feeding stations.<br/><br/>The siskin is a small, short-tailed bird, 11&ndash;12.5 centimetres (4.3&ndash;4.9&nbsp;in) in length with a wingspan that ranges from 20&ndash;23 centimetres (7.9&ndash;9.1&nbsp;in). It weighs between 10&ndash;18 grams (0.35&ndash;0.63&nbsp;oz).<br/><br/>The bird's appearance shows sexual dimorphism. The male has a greyish green back; yellow rump; the sides of the tail are yellow and the end is black; the wings are black with a distinctive yellow wing stripe; its breast is yellowish becoming whiter and striped towards the cloaca; it has a black bib (or chin patch) and on its head it has two yellow auriculas and a black cap. The amount of black on the bib is very variable between males and the size of the bib has been related to dominance within a flock. The plumage of the female is more olive-coloured than the male. The cap and the auriculas are greenish with a white bib and a rump that is a slightly striped whitish yellow. The young have a similar colouration to the females, with drab colours and a more subdued plumage.<br/><br/>The shape of the siskin's beak is determined by its feeding habits. It is strong although it is also slender in order to pick up the seeds on which they feed. The legs and feet are dark brown and the eyes are black.<br/><br/>It has a rapid and bounding flight pattern that is similar to other finches.<br/><br/>The siskin is easy to recognize, but in some instances it can be confused with other finches such as the citril finch, the greenfinch or the European serin. The European siskin, in many plumages, is a bright bird. Adult male European siskins are bright green and yellow with a black cap, and an unstreaked throat and breast. Adult females also usually have green and yellow plumage tones: for example, yellow in the supercilium and on the sides of the breast, green tones in the mantle and yellow in the rump. The ground colour of the underparts of European siskin is normally pure white. In females and juveniles, the centre of the belly and lower breast are often largely or entirely unstreaked. The wingbars of European siskin are broad and yellow (with the tips white) and the bill is short with a decurved culmen.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a resident of these warmer areas, and does not migrate in winter. It is common in all sorts of open areas with some scrub or trees, but has a preference for sunny slopes.<br/><br/>Changes in agricultural practice have affected this species very adversely at the northern fringes of its range, and in England, where it once occurred over much of the south of the country, it is now restricted to south Devon. The cirl bunting is the mascot on the signs for the village of Stokeinteignhead.<br/><br/>The cirl bunting is like a small yellowhammer, 15-16.5&nbsp;cm in length (wing-span 22-22.5&nbsp;cm) with a thick seed-eater's bill. The male has a bright yellow head, with a black crown, eyestripe and throat, and a greenish breast band across its otherwise yellow underparts, and a heavily streaked brown back. The female is much more like the yellowhammer, but has a streaked grey-brown rump and chestnut shoulders.<br/><br/>The monotonous song of the cock is rattling trill, like Arctic warbler or the terminal rattle of lesser whitethroat.<br/><br/>In the summer their natural food consists of invertebrates for example grasshoppers and crickets to feed their chicks. In the winter they feed on small seeds from over-wintered stubbles, fallow land, set-aside, and the over-winter feeding of stock with grain or hay. They tend to feed in flocks during the winter.<br/><br/>The nest is on the ground, within dense cover such as that provided by thick hedgerows and scrub. The ideal scrub is said to be blackthorn, hawthorn, bramble and gorse. The breeding season runs from April until mid-September, potentially having three broods in total. They are sedentary in nature and will often travel only 250&nbsp;m from their nests to forage in summer, and up to 2&nbsp;km in winter to find stubbles.<br/><br/>Two to five eggs are laid, which show the hair-like markings characteristic of buntings.<br/><br/>The ideal farmland habitat is a mixture of grass and arable fields, divided by thick hedgerows with pockets of dense scrub. They can tolerate a certain degree of urbanisation, and are found in green spaces in towns and cities, even Rome.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Commonname": "Great Tit",
			"Genus": "Parus",
			"species": "major",
			"Description": "The <strong>great tit</strong> (<em>Parus major</em>) is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central and Northern Asia, and parts of North Africa where it is generally resident in any sort of woodland; most great tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinctive from the great tit and these have now been separated as two distinct species, the cinereous tit of southern Asia, and the Japanese tit of East Asia. The great tit remains the most widespread species in the genus <em>Parus</em>.<br/><br/>The great tit is a distinctive bird with a black head and neck, prominent white cheeks, olive upperparts and yellow underparts, with some variation amongst the numerous subspecies. It is predominantly insectivorous in the summer, but will consume a wider range of food items in the winter months, including small hibernating bats. Like all tits it is a cavity nester, usually nesting in a hole in a tree. The female lays around 12 eggs and incubates them alone, although both parents raise the chicks. In most years the pair will raise two broods. The nests may be raided by woodpeckers, squirrels and weasels and infested with fleas, and adults may be hunted by sparrowhawks. The great tit has adapted well to human changes in the environment and is a common and familiar bird in urban parks and gardens. The great tit is also an important study species in ornithology.<br/><br/>The great tit is large for a tit at 12.5&nbsp;to 14.0&nbsp;cm (4.9&ndash;5.5&nbsp;in) in length, and has a distinctive appearance that makes it easy to recognise. The nominate race <em>P. major major</em> has a bluish-black crown, black neck, throat, bib and head, and white cheeks and ear coverts. The breast is bright lemon-yellow and there is a broad black mid-line stripe running from the bib to vent. There is a dull white spot on the neck turning to greenish yellow on the upper nape. The rest of the nape and back are green tinged with olive. The wing-coverts are green, the rest of the wing is bluish-grey with a white-wing-bar. The tail is bluish grey with white outer tips. The plumage of the female is similar to that of the male except that the colours are overall duller; the bib is less intensely black, as is the line running down the belly, which is also narrower and sometimes broken. Young birds are like the female, except that they have dull olive-brown napes and necks, greyish rumps, and greyer tails, with less defined white tips.<br/><br/>There is some variation in the subspecies. <em>P. m. newtoni</em> is like the nominate race but has a slightly longer bill, the mantle is slightly deeper green, there is less white on the tail tips, and the ventral mid-line stripe is broader on the belly. <em>P. m. corsus</em> also resembles the nominate form but has duller upperparts, less white in the tail and less yellow in the nape. <em>P. m. mallorcae</em> is like the nominate subspecies, but has a larger bill, greyer-blue upperparts and slightly paler underparts. <em>P. m. ecki</em> is like <em>P. m. mallorcae</em> except with bluer upperparts and paler underparts. <em>P. m. excelsus</em> is similar to the nominate race but has much brighter green upperparts, bright yellow underparts and no (or very little) white on the tail. <em>P. m. aphrodite</em> has darker, more olive-grey upperparts, and the underparts are more yellow to pale cream. <em>P. m. niethammeri</em> is similar to <em>P. m. aphrodite</em> but the upperparts are duller and less green, and the underparts are pale yellow. <em>P. m. terrasanctae</em> resembles the previous two subspecies but has slightly paler upperparts. <em>P. m. blandfordi</em> is like the nominate but with a greyer mantle and scapulars and pale yellow underparts, and <em>P. m. karelini</em> is intermediate between the nominate and <em>P. m. blandfordi</em>, and lacks white on the tail. The plumage of <em>P. m. bokharensis</em> is much greyer, pale creamy white to washed out grey underparts, a larger white cheep patch, a grey tail, wings, back and nape. It is also slightly smaller, with a smaller bill but longer tail. The situation is similar for the two related subspecies in the Turkestan tit group. <em>P. m. turkestanicus</em> is like <em>P. m. bokharensis</em> but with a larger bill and darker upperparts. <em>P. m. ferghanensis</em> is like <em>P. m. bokharensis</em> but with a smaller bill, darker grey on the flanks and a more yellow wash on the juvenile birds.<br/><br/>The colour of the male bird's breast has been shown to correlate with stronger sperm, and is one way that the male demonstrates his reproductive superiority to females. Higher levels of carotenoid increase the intensity of the yellow of the breast its colour, and also enable the sperm to better withstand the onslaught of free radicals. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by the bird and have to be obtained from food, so a bright colour in a male demonstrates his ability to obtain good nutrition. The width of the male's ventral stripe, which varies with individual, is selected for by females, with higher quality females apparently selecting males with wider stripes.<br/><br/>The great tit is, like other tits, a vocal bird, and has up to 40 types of calls and songs. The calls are generally the same between the sexes, but the male is much more vocal and the female rarely calls. Soft single notes such as \"pit\", \"spick\", or \"chit\" are used as contact calls. A loud \"tink\" is used by adult males as an alarm or in territorial disputes. One of the most familiar is a \"teacher, teacher\", often likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel, which is used in proclaiming ownership of a territory. In former times, English folk considered the \"saw-sharpening\" call to be a foretelling of rain. There is little geographic variation in calls, but tits from the two south Asian groups recently split from the great tit do not recognise or react to the calls of the temperate great tits.<br/><br/>One explanation for the great tit's wide repertoire is the Beau Geste theory. The eponymous hero of the novel propped dead soldiers against the battlements to give the impression that his fort was better defended than was really the case. Similarly, the multiplicity of calls gives the impression that the tit's territory is more densely occupied than it actually is. Whether the theory is correct or not, those birds with large vocabularies are socially dominant and breed more successfully.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>greater short-toed lark</strong> (<em>Calandrella brachydactyla</em>) is a small passerine bird. The current scientific name is from Ancient Greek. The genus name, <em>Calandrella</em>, is a diminutive of <em>kalandros</em>, the calandra lark, and <em>brachydactila</em> is from <em>brakhus</em>, \"short\", and <em>daktulos</em>, \"toe\".<br/><br/>It breeds in southern Europe, north-west Africa, and across temperate Asia from Turkey and southern Russia to Mongolia. During migration they form large, tight flocks that move in unison; at other times they form loose flocks.<br/><br/>Several subspecies have been named but there is considerable geneflow and the species itself forms part of a larger complex. This is a small pale lark, smaller than the skylark. It is dark-streaked greyish-brown above, and white below, and has a strong pointed bill that is pinkish with a grey culmen. It has a pale supercilium, dark patches on each side of its neck and a dark tail. Some birds in the west of the range have a rufous crown. The sexes are similar. The greater short-toed lark is paler than the Mongolian short-toed lark which also has a shorter bill. In winter they fly in large and compact flocks that swing in synchrony. Care must be taken to distinguish this species from other similar <em>Calandrella</em> larks, such as the lesser short-toed lark.<br/><br/>The nominate form breeds in Europe (Iberia, France, Italy, the Balkans and Romania) and winters in Africa. Subspecies <em>hungarica</em> breeds in the eastern parts of Europe while <em>rubiginosa</em> breeds in north-western Africa. Subspecies <em>hermonensis</em> (sometimes including <em>woltersi</em>) breeds in Turkey, Syria and Egypt. Subspecies <em>artemisiana</em> (considered by some to be synonymous with <em>longipennis</em>) breeds in Asia Minor and winters in southern west Asia. Subspecies <em>longipennis</em> breeds in Ukraine, Mongolia and Manchuria and winters in South Asia mainly in the drier zone of north-western India.<br/><br/>The song varies between a dry twittering and a more varied and imitative melody. Flocks will often fly together to water in the mornings at favourite spots. In the evenings they roost in open ground, with each bird squatting in a small depression made in the soil.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian skylark</strong> (<em>Alauda arvensis</em>) is a small passerine bird species. It is a wide-spread species found across Europe and Asia with introduced populations in many other parts of the world. The genus name is from the Latin <em>alauda</em>, \"lark\". Pliny thought the word was originally of Celtic origin. The specific <em>arvensis</em> is also Latin, and means \"of the field\".<br/><br/>The Eurasian skylark is 16 to 18&nbsp;centimetres long. It is a bird of open farmland and heath, known throughout its range for the song of the male, which is delivered in hovering flight from heights of 50 to 100&nbsp;m, when the singing bird may appear as just a dot in the sky from the ground. The long, unbroken song is a clear, bubbling warble delivered high in the air while the bird is rising, circling or hovering. The song generally lasts two to three minutes, but it tends to last longer later in the mating season, when songs can last for 20 minutes or more. The male has broader wings than the female. This adaptation for more efficient hovering flight may have evolved because of female Eurasian skylarks' preference for males that sing and hover for longer periods and so demonstrate that they are likely to have good overall fitness. Interestingly, at wind farm sites, male skylarks have been found to sing at higher frequencies as a result of wind turbine noise.<br/><br/>Like most other larks, the Eurasian skylark is a rather dull-looking species on the ground, being mainly brown above and paler below. It has a short blunt crest on the head, which can be raised and lowered. In flight it shows a short tail and short broad wings. The tail and the rear edge of the wings are edged with white, which are visible when the bird is flying away, but not if it is heading towards the observer. The Eurasian skylark has sturdy legs and spends much time on the ground foraging for seeds, supplemented with insects in the breeding season<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a sedentary (non-migratory) species. This is a common bird of dry open country, often at some altitude. Thekla's lark was named by Alfred Edmund Brehm in 1857 for his recently deceased sister Thekla Brehm (1833&ndash;1857). The name is a modern Greek one, &Theta;?&kappa;&lambda;&alpha; (Thekla), which comes from ancient Greek &Theta;&epsilon;?&kappa;&lambda;&epsilon;&iota;&alpha; (Theokleia) derived from &theta;&epsilon;?&sigmaf; (theos, \"god\") and &kappa;&lambda;?&omicron;&sigmaf; (kleos, \"glory\" or \"honour\").

It has a long, spiky, erectile crest. It is greyer than the Eurasian skylark, and lacks the white wing and tail edge of that species. It is very similar to the widespread crested lark. It is smaller and somewhat greyer than that species, and has a shorter bill. In flight it shows grey underwings, whereas the crested lark has reddish underwings.

Common to mainland Europe, the birds can also be found in northern Africa and in parts of western Asia and China. It is a non-migratory bird, but can occasionally be found as a vagrant in Great Britain.<br/><br/>A fairly small lark, the crested lark is roughly the same size as a Eurasian skylark, but shorter overall and bulkier around the head and body, and very similar in appearance, with a height of 17&nbsp;cm (6.7&nbsp;in) and a wingspan of 29 to 38&nbsp;cm (11 to 15&nbsp;in), weighing between 37 and 55&nbsp;g (1.3 and 1.9&nbsp;oz). It is a small, brown bird which has a short tail with light brown outer feathers. Male and females have no real differences, but young crested larks have more spots on their back than their older counterparts. Its plumage is downy but sparse and appears whitish. The distinct crest from which the crested lark gets its name is conspicuous at all times but is more pronounced during territorial or courtship displays and when singing. In flight it shows reddish underwings. It shares many characteristics with the Thekla lark, with the main distinctions between the two being the Thekla's heavier black-brown streaks and its grey underwing, present in European specimens.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

A small bird found mainly in grasslands, it is best identified by its rufous rump; as well, it lacks any gold on the collar and the brownish tail is tipped with white. During the breeding season, males have a zigzagging flight display accompanied by regular \"zitting\" calls that have been likened to repeated snips of a scissor. They build their pouch nest suspended within a clump of grass.<br/><br/>The zitting cisticola is 10 to 12&nbsp;cm (3.9 to 4.7&nbsp;in) in length. It is brown above, heavily streaked with black markings. The underparts are whitish, and the tail is broad, white-tipped and flicked frequently, giving rise to the alternative name for the species. The adult males have less crown streaking and more back marking than the females, but there are no great difference between the sexes or the eighteen geographical races. The absence of a nuchal collar separate it from the golden-headed cisticola (<em>Cisticola exilis</em>). In the non-breeding season, they tend to skulk within the grass and can be hard to spot.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It breeds across much of temperate Europe and western Asia. It is migratory, wintering in north and west Africa. The genus name <em>Locustella</em> is from Latin and is a diminutive of <em>locusta</em>, \"grasshopper\". Like the English name, this refers to the characteristic insect-like song of the common grasshopper warbler and some others in this genus. The specific <em>naevia</em> is Latin for \"spotted \".<br/><br/>This small passerine bird is found in short dense vegetation, often close to water. It is a medium-sized warbler about 13&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in) long. The adult has a streaked brown back and whitish grey underparts which are unstreaked except on the undertail coverts. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers, but young birds are yellower below. Like most warblers, it is insectivorous. Four to seven eggs are laid in a nest on or near the ground in thick vegetation or in a tussock of grass.<br/><br/>This is a species which skulks in the undergrowth, creeping through bushes and low foliage, and which is very difficult to see except sometimes when singing from a prominent position. The song, which gives this species its name, is a monotonous mechanical insect-like reeling, often given at dawn or dusk.<br/><br/>The adult common grasshopper warbler (the name is the IOC recommended English name) has a length of about 12.5&nbsp;cm (5&nbsp;in). It is a very secretive bird and seldom seen, but its presence is easily detected because of its characteristic song. The upper-parts are pale olive-brown, each feather having a central darker brown streak. The cheeks are greyish, the irises are brown and there is a faint eye streak behind the eye. The upper mandible of the beak is dark brown and the lower mandible yellowish-brown. The underparts are cream-coloured or yellowish-buff with a few dark brown spots and streaks on the breast and flanks. The wings are brown with the outer edge of the feathers rimmed with paler brown. The tail feathers are reddish-brown with faint transverse bars being visible in some individuals and the under-tail coverts are streaked. The slender legs and the feet are pale yellowish-brown.<br/><br/>The song is an unmusical long, high-pitched reeling trill performed with beak held wide open and the whole body vibrating. It lasts for from a few seconds to two or three minutes with hardly a pause for breath. It varies in volume from a faint hum to a sound resembling a distant mowing machine. It is performed at any time of day from early morning until after the sun has set and is constantly to be heard from the arrival of the bird in spring until late July. The alarm call is a repeated ticking noise that has been rendered as \"twkit-twkit-twkit\".<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

There have been a few reports from Great Britain, including a pair breeding in Cambridgeshire in 1946, but these records have recently been removed from the official list of British birds, being unconvincingly distinguished from sedge warblers or paddyfield warblers.<br/><br/>This passerine bird is a species found in upright aquatic vegetation such as reeds and sedge. 3-6 eggs are laid from mid-April and incubated for 14&ndash;15 days. The nest is built over water among reeds or rushes or in a bush. This species is usually monogamous (Leisler &amp; Wink 2000).<br/><br/>This is a medium-sized warbler, 12-13.5&nbsp;cm long, slightly larger than the similar sedge warbler, <em>Acrocephalus schoenobaenus</em>.

			"Description": "The <strong>great reed warbler</strong> (<em>Acrocephalus arundinaceus</em>) is a Eurasian passerine in the genus <em>Acrocephalus</em>.<br/><br/>The genus name <em>Acrocephalus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>akros</em>, \"highest\", and <em>kephale</em>, \"head\". It is possible that Naumann and Naumann thought <em>akros</em> meant \"sharp-pointed\". The specific <em>arundinaceus</em> is from Latin and means \"like a reed\", from <em>arundo, arundinis</em>, \"reed\".<br/><br/>It used to be placed in the Old World warbler assemblage, but is now recognized as part of the marsh and tree-warbler family (Acrocephalidae). Great reed warblers are medium-sized birds and are the largest of the European warblers. They breed throughout mainland Europe and Asia and migrate to sub-Saharan Africa in the winter. Great reed warblers favour reed beds as their habitat during breeding months, while living in reed beds, bush thickets, rice fields, and forest clearings during the winter. Great reed warblers exhibit relatively low sexual dimorphism, and both genders of the species are similar in appearance. This species mates both polygynously and monogamously.<br/><br/>The thrush-sized warbler is one of the largest species of Old World warbler. It measures 16&ndash;21&nbsp;cm (6.3&ndash;8.3&nbsp;in) in length, 25 to 30&nbsp;cm (9.8 to 11.8&nbsp;in) in wingspan and weighs 22 to 38&nbsp;g (0.78 to 1.34&nbsp;oz). The adult has unstreaked brown upperparts and dull buffish-white chin and underparts. The forehead is flattened, and the bill is strong and pointed. It looks very much like a giant Eurasian reed warbler (<em>A. scirpaceus</em>), but with a stronger supercilium.<br/><br/>The sexes are identical, as with most old world warblers, but young birds are richer buff below.<br/><br/>The warbler's song is very loud and far-carrying. The song's main phrase is a chattering and creaking <em>carr-carr-cree-cree-cree-jet-jet</em>, to which the whistles and vocal mimicry typical of marsh warblers are added.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>common house martin</strong> (<em>Delichon urbicum</em>), sometimes called the <strong>northern house martin</strong> or, particularly in Europe, just <strong>house martin</strong>, is a migratory passerine bird of the swallow family which breeds in Europe, north Africa and temperate Asia; and winters in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia. It feeds on insects which are caught in flight, and it migrates to climates where flying insects are plentiful. It has a blue head and upperparts, white rump and pure white underparts, and is found in both open country and near human habitation. It is similar in appearance to the two other martin species of the genus <em>Delichon</em>, which are both endemic to eastern and southern Asia. It has two accepted subspecies.<br/><br/>Both the scientific and colloquial name of the bird are related to its use of human-made structures. It builds a closed cup nest from mud pellets under eaves or similar locations on buildings usually in colonies.<br/><br/>It is hunted by the Eurasian hobby (<em>Falco subbuteo</em>), and like other birds is affected by internal parasites and external fleas and mites, although its large range and population mean that it is not threatened globally.<br/><br/>The adult common house martin of the western nominate race is 13&nbsp;cm (5.1&nbsp;in) long, with a wing span of 26&ndash;29&nbsp;cm (10&ndash;11&nbsp;in) and a weight averaging 18.3&nbsp;g (0.65&nbsp;oz). It is steel-blue above with a white rump, and white underparts, including the underwings; even its short legs have white downy feathering. It has brown eyes and a small black bill, and its toes and exposed parts of the legs are pink. The sexes are similar, but the juvenile bird is sooty black, and some of its wing coverts and quills have white tips and edgings. <em>D. u. lagopodum</em> differs from the nominate race in that its white rump extends much further onto the tail, and the fork of its tail is intermediate in depth between that of <em>D. u. urbicum</em> and that of the Asian house martin.<br/><br/>The white rump and underparts of the common house martin, very noticeable in flight, prevent confusion with other widespread Palaeoarctic swallows such as the barn swallow (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>), sand martin (<em>Riparia riparia</em>) or red-rumped swallow (<em>Cecropis daurica</em>). In Africa, confusion with grey-rumped swallow (<em>Pseudhirundo griseopyga</em>) is possible, but that species has a grey rump, off-white underparts and long, deeply forked tail. The common house martin flies with a wing beat averaging 5.3&nbsp;beats per second, which is faster than the wing beat of 4.4&nbsp;beats per second for the barn swallow, but the flight speed of 11&nbsp;m&middot;s<sup>&minus;1</sup> (36&nbsp;ft&middot;s<sup>&minus;1</sup>) is typical for hirundines.<br/><br/>The common house martin is a noisy species, especially at its breeding colonies. The male's song, given throughout the year, is a soft twitter of melodious chirps. The contact call, also given on the wintering grounds, is a hard <em>chirrrp</em>, and the alarm is a shrill <em>tseep</em>.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It breeds in open hilly country of temperate southern Europe and Asia from Portugal and Spain to Japan, India, Sri Lanka and tropical Africa. The Indian and African birds are resident, but European and other Asian birds are migratory. They winter in Africa or India and are vagrants to Christmas Island and northern Australia.<br/><br/>Red-rumped swallows are somewhat similar in habits and appearance to the other aerial insectivores, such as the related swallows and the unrelated swifts (order Apodiformes). They have blue upperparts and dusky underparts.<br/><br/>They resemble barn swallows, but are darker below and have pale or reddish rumps, face and neck collar. They lack a breast band, but have black undertails. They are fast fliers and they swoop on insects while airborne. They have broad but pointed wings.<br/><br/>Red-rumped swallows build quarter-sphere nests with a tunnel entrance lined with mud collected in their beaks, and lay 3 to 6 eggs. They normally nest under cliff overhangs in their mountain homes, but will readily adapt to buildings such as mosques and bridges.<br/><br/>They do not normally form large breeding colonies, but are gregarious outside the breeding season. Many hundreds can be seen at a time on the plains of India.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Commonname": "Barn Swallow",
			"Genus": "Hirundo",
			"species": "rustica",
			"Description": "The <strong>barn swallow</strong> (<em>Hirundo rustica</em>) is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the <strong>swallow</strong>; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \"swallow\" rather than a \"martin\".<br/><br/>There are six subspecies of barn swallow, which breed across the Northern Hemisphere. Four are strongly migratory, and their wintering grounds cover much of the Southern Hemisphere as far south as central Argentina, the Cape Province of South Africa, and northern Australia. Its huge range means that the barn swallow is not endangered, although there may be local population declines due to specific threats.<br/><br/>The barn swallow is a bird of open country that normally uses man-made structures to breed and consequently has spread with human expansion. It builds a cup nest from mud pellets in barns or similar structures and feeds on insects caught in flight. This species lives in close association with humans, and its insect-eating habits mean that it is tolerated by humans; this acceptance was reinforced in the past by superstitions regarding the bird and its nest. There are frequent cultural references to the barn swallow in literary and religious works due to both its living in close proximity to humans and its annual migration. The barn swallow is the national bird of Estonia.<br/><br/>The adult male barn swallow of the nominate subspecies <em>H. r. rustica</em> is 17&ndash;19&nbsp;cm (6.7&ndash;7.5&nbsp;in) long including 2&ndash;7&nbsp;cm (0.79&ndash;2.76&nbsp;in) of elongated outer tail feathers. It has a wingspan of 32&ndash;34.5&nbsp;cm (12.6&ndash;13.6&nbsp;in) and weighs 16&ndash;22&nbsp;g (0.56&ndash;0.78&nbsp;oz). It has steel blue upperparts and a rufous forehead, chin and throat, which are separated from the off-white underparts by a broad dark blue breast band. The outer tail feathers are elongated, giving the distinctive deeply forked \"swallow tail\". There is a line of white spots across the outer end of the upper tail. The female is similar in appearance to the male, but the tail streamers are shorter, the blue of the upperparts and breast band is less glossy, and the underparts paler. The juvenile is browner and has a paler rufous face and whiter underparts. It also lacks the long tail streamers of the adult.<br/><br/>The song of the barn swallow is a cheerful warble, often ending with <em>su-seer</em> with the second note higher than the first but falling in pitch. Calls include <em>witt</em> or <em>witt-witt</em> and a loud <em>splee-plink</em> when excited (or trying to chase intruders away from the nest). The alarm calls include a sharp <em>siflitt</em> for predators like cats and a <em>flitt-flitt</em> for birds of prey like the hobby. This species is fairly quiet on the wintering grounds.<br/><br/>The distinctive combination of a red face and blue breast band render the adult barn swallow easy to distinguish from the African <em>Hirundo</em> species and from the welcome swallow (<em>Hirundo neoxena</em>) with which its range overlaps in Australasia. In Africa the short tail streamers of the juvenile barn swallow invite confusion with juvenile red-chested swallow (<em>Hirundo lucida</em>), but the latter has a narrower breast band and more white in the tail.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Genus": "Ptyonoprogne",
			"species": "rupestris",
			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian crag martin</strong> or just <strong>crag martin</strong> (<em>Ptyonoprogne rupestris</em>) is a small passerine bird in the swallow family. It is about 14&nbsp;cm (5.5&nbsp;in) long with ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and a short, square tail that has distinctive white patches on most of its feathers. It breeds in the mountains of southern Europe, northwestern Africa and southern Asia. It can be confused with the three other species in its genus, but is larger than both, with brighter tail spots and different plumage tone. Many European birds are resident, but some northern populations and most Asian breeders are migratory, wintering in northern Africa, the Middle East or India.<br/><br/>The Eurasian crag martin builds a nest adherent to the rock under a cliff overhang or increasingly onto a man-made structure. It makes a neat half-cup mud nest with an inner soft lining of feathers and dry grass. Nests are often solitary, although a few pairs may breed relatively close together at good locations. Two to five brown-blotched white eggs are incubated mainly by the female, and both parents feed the chicks. This species does not form large breeding colonies, but is gregarious outside the breeding season. It feeds on a wide variety of insects that are caught in its beak as the martin flies near to cliff faces or over streams and alpine meadows. Adults and young may be hunted and eaten by birds of prey or corvids, and this species is a host of blood-sucking mites. With its very large and expanding range and large population there are no significant conservation concerns.<br/><br/>This bird is closely related to the other three crag martins which share its genus, and has sometimes been considered to be the same species as one or both, although it appears that there are areas where two species' ranges overlap without hybridisation occurring. All three <em>Ptyonoprogne</em> crag martins are quite similar in behaviour to other Old World swallows that build mud nests, and are sometimes subsumed into the larger genus <em>Hirundo</em>, but this approach leads to inconsistencies in classifying other genera, particularly the house martins.<br/><br/>The Eurasian crag martin is 13&ndash;15&nbsp;cm (5.1&ndash;5.9&nbsp;in) long with a 32&ndash;34.5&nbsp;cm (12.6&ndash;13.6&nbsp;in) wingspan, and weighs an average 23&nbsp;g (0.81&nbsp;oz). It has ash-brown upperparts and paler underparts, and has a broader body, wings and tail than any other European swallow. The tail is short and square, with white patches near the tips of all but the central and outermost pairs of feathers. The underwing and undertail coverts are blackish, the eyes are brown, the small bill is mainly black, and the legs are brownish-pink. The sexes are alike, but juveniles have buff-brown tips to the plumage of the head, upperparts and wing coverts. This species can be distinguished from the sand martin by its larger size, the white patches on the tail, and its lack of a brown breast band. Where the range overlaps with that of another <em>Ptyonoprogne</em> species, the Eurasian crag martin is darker, browner and 15% larger than the rock martin, and larger and paler, particularly on its underparts than the dusky crag martin. The white tail spots of the Eurasian crag martin are significantly larger than those of both its relatives.<br/><br/>The crag martin's flight appears relatively slow for a swallow. Rapid wing beats are interspersed with flat-winged glides, and its long flexible primaries give it the agility to manoeuvre near cliff faces. The average migration flight speed has been measured at 9.9&nbsp;m/s (32.5&nbsp;ft/s), less than the roughly 11&nbsp;m/s (36&nbsp;ft/s) typical for hirundines, but the data is limited. The bird often flies high, and shows the white spots as it spreads its tail. The vocalisations include short high <em>pli</em>, and <em>piieh</em> and <em>tshir</em> calls resembling those of the linnet and the house martin respectively.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It was formerly regarded as the western subspecies of a wider \"Bonelli's warbler\" species, but as a result of modern taxonomic developments, this species is now usually considered to be two species:<ul><li>Western Bonelli's warbler, <em>Phylloscopus bonelli</em>, which breeds in south west Europe and north Africa</li><li>Eastern Bonelli's warbler, <em>Phylloscopus orientalis</em>, which breeds in south east Europe and Asia Minor</li></ul><br/><br/>The breeding ranges of the two species do not overlap; while their appearance and songs are very similar, the calls are completely different (see below). They also show marked difference in mtDNA sequence.<br/><br/>The species is migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. It is a rare vagrant in Northern Europe.<br/><br/>The genus name <em>Phylloscopus</em> is from Ancient Greek <em>phullon</em>, \"leaf\", and <em>skopos</em>, \"seeker\" (from <em>skopeo</em>, \"to watch\"). The English name and the specific <em>bonelli</em> are for the Italian ornithologist Franco Andrea Bonelli.<br/><br/>Western Bonelli's warbler is a small passerine bird, found in forest and woodland. 4&ndash;6 eggs are laid in a nest on the ground. Like most warblers, western Bonelli's is insectivorous.<br/><br/>The adult has a plain grey-green back, green-toned rump and wings and whitish underparts. The bill is small and pointed and the legs brown. The sexes are identical, as with most warblers.<br/><br/>The western Bonelli's warbler has a browner tinge to the upperparts than eastern Bonelli's warbler; the latter sometimes has a greenish tinge instead. The song is a fast monotone trill, only slightly different from eastern Bonelli's, and also some similarity to wood warbler. The call of the western Bonelli's warbler is a disyllabic <em>hu-it</em>, differing from that of eastern which is a completely different hard <em>chup</em>, reminiscent of a crossbill or a house sparrow.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It has declined there in recent years; it is now very rare in Ireland, where only one or two pairs are recorded breeding in most years, usually in County Wicklow.<br/><br/>Various factors associated with forest structure, including slope, forest cover, proportion of broad-leaf forest, canopy height and forest edge length, all influenced the occupancy rates of this declining forest species.

This warbler is strongly migratory and winters mainly in tropical South Asia and South-east Asia, but also in small numbers in western Europe. Like the rest of Phylloscopidae, it was formerly included in the Old World warbler assemblage.<br/><br/>It was formerly considered to comprise three subspecies, but <em>P. i. humei</em> and <em>P. i. mandellii</em> are now split as a separate species, Hume's leaf warbler <em>P. humei</em>, leaving <em>P. inornatus</em> monotypic. The two sister species differ slightly but consistently in morphology, bioacoustics, and molecular characters. Before the species was split, the names yellow-browed willow warbler and inornate warbler were used by a few authors.<br/><br/>This is one of the smaller Old World warblers, at 9.5&ndash;11&nbsp;cm long and weighing 4&ndash;9 g distinctly smaller than a chiffchaff but slightly larger than Pallas's leaf warbler. Like many other leaf warblers, it has overall greenish upperparts and white underparts. It also has prominent double wing bars formed by yellowish-white tips to the wing covert feathers (a long bar on the greater coverts and a short bar on the median coverts), yellow-margined tertial feathers, and long yellow supercilium. Some individuals also have a faint paler green central crown stripe though many do not show this.<br/><br/>It is not shy, but its arboreal life style makes it difficult to observe. It is almost constantly in motion. Its song is a high pitched medley of whistles; the call is piercing, often disyllabic \"tseeweest\", strikingly loud for the bird's small size. The only real possibility of confusion is with the similar-looking Hume's leaf warbler (<em>P. humei</em>), which in the limited area of overlap has duller colours, a faint second wing bar and dark legs and lower mandible. Their songs and calls are clearly distinct, with Hume's having a more chirping \"chwee\" call. It can easily be distinguished from Pallas's warbler as it does not have the a conspicuous yellow central crown stripe and rump patch shown by that species.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Greenish-brown above and off-white below, it is named onomatopoeically for its simple <em>chiff-chaff</em> song. It has a number of subspecies, some of which are now treated as full species. The female builds a domed nest on or near the ground, and assumes most of the responsibility for brooding and feeding the chicks, whilst the male has little involvement in nesting, but defends his territory against rivals, and attacks potential predators.<br/><br/>A small insectivorous bird, it is subject to predation by mammals, such as cats and mustelids, and birds, particularly hawks of the genus <em>Accipiter</em>. Its large range and population mean that its status is secure, although one subspecies is probably extinct.<br/><br/>The common chiffchaff is a small, dumpy, 10&ndash;12&nbsp;centimetres (4&nbsp;in) long leaf warbler. The male weighs 7&ndash;8&nbsp;grammes (0.28&ndash;0.31&nbsp;oz), and the female 6&ndash;7&nbsp;grammes (0.25&ndash;0.28&nbsp;oz). The spring adult of the western nominate subspecies <em>P. c. collybita</em> has brown-washed dull green upperparts, off-white underparts becoming yellowish on the flanks, and a short whitish supercilium. It has dark legs, a fine dark bill, and short primary projection (extension of the flight feathers beyond the folded wing). As the plumage wears, it gets duller and browner, and the yellow on the flanks tends to be lost, but after the breeding season there is a prolonged complete moult before migration. The newly fledged juvenile is browner above than the adult, with yellow-white underparts, but moults about 10 weeks after acquiring its first plumage. After moulting, both the adult and the juvenile have brighter and greener upperparts and a paler supercilium.<br/><br/>This warbler gets its name from its simple distinctive song, a repetitive cheerful <em>chiff-chaff</em>. This song is one of the first avian signs that spring has returned. Its call is a <em>hweet</em>, less disyllabic than the <em>hooeet</em> of the willow warbler or <em>hu-it</em> of the western Bonelli's warbler.<br/><br/>The song differs from that of the Iberian chiffchaff, which has a shorter <em>djup djup djup wheep wheep chittichittichiittichitta</em>. However, mixed singers occur in the hybridisation zone and elsewhere, and can be difficult to allocate to species.<br/><br/>When not singing, the common chiffchaff can be difficult to distinguish from other leaf warblers with greenish upperparts and whitish underparts, particularly the willow warbler. However, that species has a longer primary projection, a sleeker, brighter appearance and generally pale legs. Bonelli's warbler (<em>P. bonelli)</em> might be confused with the common chiffchaff subspecies <em>tristis</em>, but it has a plain face and green in the wings. The common chiffchaff also has rounded wings in flight, and a diagnostic tail movement consisting of a dip, then sidewards wag, that distinguishes it from other <em>Phylloscopus</em> warblers and gives rise to the name \"tailwagger\" in India.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest challenge is distinguishing non-singing birds of the nominate subspecies from Iberian chiffchaff in the field. In Great Britain and the Netherlands, all accepted records of vagrant Iberian chiffchaffs relate to singing males.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a small, brown bush-warbler which breeds in southern and central Europe, north-west Africa and east southern temperate Asia as far as Afghanistan and north-west Pakistan. The bird is named after the 18th century Italian zoologist, Francesco Cetti. This species is very difficult to see because of its skulking habits.<br/><br/>The Cetti&rsquo;s warbler is approximately 13&ndash;14&nbsp;cm (5.1&ndash;5.5&nbsp;in) from bill to tail. The male weighs 15&nbsp;g (0.53&nbsp;oz) and the female 12&nbsp;g (0.42&nbsp;oz). Cetti&rsquo;s warblers have a rounded head with a narrow pale grey stripe arching over conspicuous black eyes, and short, rounded wings. They are a rich chestnut or dark reddish-brown colour on the upperparts. They are pale grey on the throat and stomach, with a longer and broader tail than many other warblers. Both sexes looks alike, but males are 26% to 32% heavier than females with a wing-length 11.2% to 13.% longer. The male has a wing longer than 60&nbsp;mm; the female has a wing shorter than 55&nbsp;mm. The birds can be aged by their plumage; juveniles look similar to adults but have fresh plumage and two dark or dark grey spots on the tongue. Cetti's warbler is unusual among passerine birds in having ten tail feathers (rectrices) rather than the usual twelve.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Commonname": "Eurasian Blackcap",
			"Genus": "Sylvia",
			"species": "atricapilla",
			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian blackcap</strong> (<em>Sylvia atricapilla</em>) usually known simply as the <strong>blackcap</strong>, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite different but has a similar song.<br/><br/>The blackcap breeds in much of Europe, western Asia and northwestern Africa, and its preferred habitat is mature deciduous woodland. The male holds a territory when breeding, which is defended against garden warblers as well as other blackcaps. The nest is a neat cup, built low in brambles or scrub, and the clutch is typically 4&ndash;6 mainly buff eggs, which hatch in about 11&nbsp;days. The chicks fledge in 11&ndash;12&nbsp;days, but are cared for by both adults for some time after leaving the nest. The blackcap is a partial migrant; birds from the colder areas of its range winter in scrub or trees in northwestern Europe, around the Mediterranean and in tropical Africa. Some German birds have adapted to spending the winter in gardens in Great Britain and Ireland. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, but, for the rest of the year, blackcaps survive primarily on small fruit. Garden birds also eat bread, fat and peanuts in winter.<br/><br/>Despite extensive hunting in Mediterranean countries and the natural hazards of predation and disease, the blackcap has been extending its range for several decades, and is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as Least Concern. Its rich and varied song has led to it being described as the \"mock nightingale\" and it has featured in literature, films and music. In Messiaen's opera <em>Saint Fran&ccedil;ois d'Assise</em>, the saint is represented by themes based on the blackcap's song.<br/><br/>The blackcap is a mainly grey warbler with distinct male and female plumages. The nominate subspecies is about 13&nbsp;cm (5.1&nbsp;in) long with a 7&ndash;8&nbsp;cm (2.8&ndash;3.1&nbsp;in) wing length. The weight is typically 16&ndash;25&nbsp;g (0.56&ndash;0.88&nbsp;oz), but can be up to 31&nbsp;g (1.1&nbsp;oz) for birds preparing to migrate. The adult male has olive-grey upperparts, other than a paler grey nape and a neat black cap on the head. The underparts are light grey, becoming silvery white on the chin, throat and upper breast. The tail is dark grey, with an olive tint to the outer edge of each feather. The bill and long legs are grey, and the iris is reddish brown. The female resembles the male, but has a reddish-brown cap and a slightly browner tone to the grey of the upperparts. Juveniles are similar to the female, but their upperparts have a slight rufous tinge, and the breast and flanks have a more olive tone; young males have a darker brown cap than their female counterparts. This species is unmistakable; other dark-headed <em>Sylvia</em> species, such Sardinian and Orphean warblers have extensive black on the head instead of a small cap. They are also larger and have white edges on the tail.<br/><br/>Blackcaps have a complete moult in their breeding areas in August and September prior to migration. Some birds, typically those migrating the greatest distances, have a further partial moult between December and March. Juveniles replace their loosely structured body feathers with adult plumage, starting earlier, but taking longer to complete, than the adults. Blackcaps breeding in the north of the range have an earlier and shorter post-juvenile moult than those further south, and cross-breeding of captive birds shows that the timing is genetically controlled.<br/><br/>The male's song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, which is given in bursts of up to 30&nbsp;seconds. The song is repeated for about two-and-a-half minutes, with a short pause before each repetition. In some geographically isolated areas, such as islands, peninsulas and valleys in the Alps, a simplified fluting song occurs, named the <em>Leiern</em> (drawling) song by the German ornithologists who first described it. The song's introduction is like that of other blackcaps, but the final warbling part is a simple alternation between two notes, as in a great tit's call but more fluting. The main song is confusable with that of the garden warbler, but it is slightly higher pitched than in that species, more broken into discrete song segments, and less mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is even more difficult to separate. The blackcap occasionally mimics the song of other birds, the most frequently copied including the garden warbler and the common nightingale. The main call is a hard <em>tac-tac</em>, like stones knocking together, and other vocalisations include a squeaking <em>sweet</em> alarm, and a low-pitched trill similar to that of a garden warbler.<br/><br/>Male blackcaps will sometimes sing even when incubating, especially with the second brood. This appears to be intended to maintain the bond with the female. Wintering birds in Africa are quiet initially, but start singing in January or February prior to their return north<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Order": "Passeriformes",
			"Family": "Sylviidae",
			"Commonname": "Garden Warbler",
			"Genus": "Sylvia",
			"species": "borin",
			"Description": "The <strong>garden warbler</strong> (<em>Sylvia borin</em>) is a common and widespread small bird that breeds in most of Europe and in western Asia. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed typical warbler with brown upperparts and dull white underparts; the sexes are similar and juveniles resemble the adults. Its two subspecies differ only slightly and interbreed where their ranges overlap. Due to its lack of distinguishing features, this species can be confused with a number of other unstreaked warblers. The garden warbler's rich melodic song is similar to that of the blackcap, its closest relative, which competes with it for territory when nesting in the same woodland.<br/><br/>The preferred breeding habitat in Eurasia is open woodland with dense low cover for nesting; despite its name, gardens are rarely occupied by this small passerine bird. The clutch of four or five blotched cream or white eggs is laid in a robust cup-shaped nest built near the ground and concealed by dense vegetation. The eggs are incubated for 11&ndash;12&nbsp;days. The chicks are altricial, hatching naked and with closed eyes, and are fed by both parents. They fledge about 10&nbsp;days after hatching. Only about a quarter of young birds survive their first year. The garden warbler is strongly migratory, wintering in sub-Saharan Africa. A wide range of habitats are used in Africa, but closed forest and treeless Sahel are both shunned. Insects are the main food in the breeding season, although fruit predominates when birds are fattening prior to migration, figs being a particular favourite where available. These warblers have a mixed diet of insects and fruit in their African wintering grounds.<br/><br/>The garden warbler is hunted by Eurasian sparrowhawks and domestic cats, and its eggs and nestlings are taken by a variety of mammalian and avian predators. It may be host to various fleas, mites and internal parasites, and it is a host of the common cuckoo, a brood parasite. The large and fairly stable numbers and huge range of the garden warbler mean that it is classed as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Despite a small population decline in much of its European range, the bird's breeding distribution is expanding northwards in Scandinavia.<br/><br/>The garden warbler is 14&nbsp;cm (5.5&nbsp;in) long with a 7.6&ndash;8.4&nbsp;cm (3.0&ndash;3.3&nbsp;in) wing length. The weight is typically 16&ndash;22&nbsp;g (0.56&ndash;0.78&nbsp;oz), but can be up to 35.5&nbsp;g (1.25&nbsp;oz) for birds preparing to migrate. It is a plain, long-winged and long-tailed bird with unstreaked olive-brown upperparts and dull white underparts. It has a whitish eyering and a faint pale supercilium, and there is a buff wash to the throat and flanks. The eye is black, the legs are bluish-grey and the strong bill has a grey upper and paler grey lower mandible. The male and female are indistinguishable by external appearance including size. Juveniles have a looser plumage than an adult, with paler and greyer upperparts and a buff tone to the underparts. The eastern subspecies <em>S. b. woodwardi</em> is slightly larger and paler than the nominate form with a greyer tone to the upperparts and whiter underparts. The subspecies are hard to distinguish visually where they occur together in Africa, but a wing length greater than 80&nbsp;mm (3.1&nbsp;in) confirms <em>S. b. woodwardi</em> when birds are trapped.<br/><br/>The plain appearance of the garden warbler means that it can be confused with several other species. The melodious and icterine warblers usually have long bills and a yellowish tint to their plumage. The booted warbler is similar in colour, although it is smaller, more delicately built and has a flesh-coloured bill. Western and eastern olivaceous warblers are also relatively small, and have white outer tail feathers as well as a pinkish bill. Juvenile barred warblers, which lack the obvious barring of adults, are much larger than garden warblers and have a pale double wingbar.<br/><br/>Juvenile garden warblers have a partial moult mainly involving the body plumage between June and September prior to migration. Adults also have a similar, but sometimes more extensive, partial moult in late summer, and a complete moult in their African wintering areas before the return migration.<br/><br/>The male's song, usually delivered by birds in dense cover, is a rich musical warbling usually delivered in bursts of a few seconds duration, but sometimes for longer periods. The song is confusable with that of the blackcap, although compared to that species it is slightly lower-pitched, less broken into discrete song segments and more mellow. Both species have a quiet subsong, a muted version of the full song, which is much more difficult to separate. The most frequent call of the garden warbler is a sharp <em>kek-kek</em>, which is repeated rapidly when the bird is alarmed. A quiet rasping <em>tchurr-r-r-r</em> resembling the main call of the common whitethroat is also sometimes heard. The juvenile has a <em>quia</em> alarm vocalisation. The garden warbler will occasionally mimic other birds, and is itself frequently mimicked by the blackcap. Both <em>Sylvia</em> warblers will also sing against common nightingales, which have a similar song despite being unrelated. Subsong may be heard on the wintering grounds in Africa, developing into the full song in March and April prior to the return to Europe.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is mainly resident in Africa, but other populations migrate to winter in more widely in north and west Africa and Egypt. This bird is a rare vagrant to northern and western Europe.<br/><br/>It also occurs in some Atlantic islands. The subspecies <em>orbitalis</em> has been proposed for those of the Cape Verde Islands. The presumed subspecies for the Madeira birds, <em>bella</em> is today usually included in this taxon, as are the birds of the Canary Islands, where the species is quite common except on El Hierro and known as <em>zarzalero y ratonero</em>.<br/><br/>These are very small \"warblers\" and are intermediate between whitethroats and Tristram's warbler in coloration. Spectacled warblers are brown above and buff below, with chestnut wing patches and a white throat. Adult males have a grey head and the white eye ring which gives the species its name. Immature birds can be confused with both the whitethroat and the subalpine warbler, and identification is difficult in the field. The song is a fast high warble.<br/><br/>About the precise relationships of this bird, not much can be said with certainty.

It groups with the Marmora's warbler, Tristram's warbler and the Dartford warbler (Helbig 2001, J&oslash;nsson &amp; Fjelds&aring; 2006).<br/><br/>These are small, long tailed, large-headed birds, overall very similar to their close relatives in the Dartford warbler group. Balearic warblers are grey above and pale grey below, adding a pinkish tinge. Adult males have darker patches on the forehead and between the eye and the pointed bill. The legs and iris are red.<br/><br/>These small passerine birds are found in open country with thorny bushes and heather. 3-5 eggs are laid in a nest in a bush. Like most \"warblers\", they are insectivorous.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Dartford warbler</strong> (<em>Sylvia undata</em>) is a typical warbler from the warmer parts of western Europe and northwestern Africa. It is a small warbler with a long thin tail and a thin pointed bill. The adult male has grey-brown upperparts and is dull reddish-brown below except for the centre of the belly which has a dirty white patch. It has light speckles on the throat and a red eye-ring. The sexes are similar but the adult female is usually less grey above and paler below.<br/><br/>Its breeding range lies west of a line from southern England to the heel of Italy (southern Apulia). The Dartford warbler is usually resident all year in its breeding range, but there is some limited migration.<br/><br/>The Dartford warbler is a small (13&nbsp;cm (5.1&nbsp;in)) passerine bird, distinguished by its long tail compared with that of other warblers. Its plumage comprises unobtrusive and muted tones, which blend in with the dry dead plants, old wood or sunny greyish wood found in its preferred habitats.<br/><br/>Like many typical warblers, the Dartford warbler has distinct male and female plumages. The male has a grey back and head, reddish underparts, and a red eye. The reddish throat is spotted with white. The sides are a dull greyish tone, being more clear about the abdomen. In some populations males have bluish-grey or brownish-grey backs and heads. The female is paler below, especially on the throat, and a browner grey above. The female's throat also has white spots, although they are smaller and less marked than in the male. Juvenile birds are similar to females.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Order": "Passeriformes",
			"Family": "Regulidae",
			"Commonname": "Goldcrest",
			"Genus": "Regulus",
			"species": "regulus",
			"Description": "The <strong>goldcrest</strong> (<em>Regulus regulus</em>) is a very small passerine bird in the kinglet family. Its colourful golden crest feathers gives rise to its English and scientific names, and possibly to it being called the \"king of the birds\" in European folklore. Several subspecies are recognised across the very large distribution range that includes much of Eurasia and the islands of Macaronesia. Birds from the north and east of its breeding range migrate to winter further south.<br/><br/>This kinglet has greenish upper-parts, whitish under-parts, and has two white wingbars. It has a plain face contrasting black irises and a bright head crest, orange and yellow in the male and yellow in the female, which is displayed during breeding. It superficially resembles the firecrest, which largely shares its European range, but the latter's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly higher-pitched than those of its relative. Birds on the Canary Islands are now separated into two subspecies of the goldcrest, but were formerly considered to be a subspecies of the common firecrest or a separate species, <em>Regulus teneriffae</em>.<br/><br/>The goldcrest breeds in coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Ten to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone, and the chicks are fed by both parents; second broods are common. This kinglet is constantly on the move as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. It may be killed by birds of prey or carry parasites, but its large range and population mean that it is not considered to present any significant conservation concerns.<br/><br/>The goldcrest is the smallest European bird, 8.5&ndash;9.5&nbsp;cm (3.3&ndash;3.7&nbsp;in) in length, with a 13.5&ndash;15.5&nbsp;cm (5.3&ndash;6.1&nbsp;in) wingspan and a weight of 4.5&ndash;7.0&nbsp;g (0.16&ndash;0.25&nbsp;oz). It is similar in appearance to a warbler, with olive-green upper-parts, buff-white underparts, two white wing bars, and a plain face with conspicuous black irises. The crown of the head has black sides and a narrow black front, and a bright crest, yellow with an orange centre in the male, and entirely yellow in the female; the crest is erected in display, making the distinctive orange stripe of the male much more conspicuous. The small, thin bill is black, and the legs are dark flesh-brown. Apart from the crest colour, the sexes are alike, although in fresh plumage, the female may have very slightly paler upper-parts and greyer underparts than the adult male. The juvenile is similar to the adult, but has duller upper-parts and lacks the coloured crown. Although the tail and flight feathers may be retained into the first winter, by then the young birds are almost indistinguishable from adults in the field. The flight is distinctive; it consists of whirring wing-beats with occasional sudden changes of direction. Shorter flights while feeding are a mix of dashing and fluttering with frequent hovering. It moves restlessly among foliage, regularly creeping on branches and up and down trunks.<br/><br/>The goldcrest is usually easily distinguished from other small birds in its range, but poor views could possibly lead to confusion with the common firecrest or yellow-browed warbler. The adult common firecrest has a distinguishing face pattern showing a bright white supercilium (eyebrow) and black eye-stripe, and the juvenile usually shows enough of this face pattern to be readily distinguished from the plain-faced goldcrest. The yellow-browed warbler has a yellowish supercilium and pale crown stripe, so also shows a different head pattern. The ruby-crowned kinglet, an American <em>Regulus</em> species and a potential vagrant in Europe, could be more difficult to distinguish. It has a plain face like its Old World cousin, but the male has a red crest without any yellow or a black border. Female and juvenile ruby-crowned kinglets lack the ruby-red crown patch, but compared with the similarly crestless juvenile goldcrest, the American bird is larger in size, has an obvious whitish eyering, and yellowish wing bars.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>common firecrest</strong> (<em>Regulus ignicapilla</em>) also known as the <strong>firecrest</strong>, is a very small passerine bird in the kinglet family. It breeds in most of temperate Europe and northwestern Africa, and is partially migratory, with birds from central Europe wintering to the south and west of their breeding range. Firecrests in the Balearic Islands and north Africa are widely recognised as a separate subspecies, but the population on Madeira, previously also treated as a subspecies, is now treated as a distinct species, the Madeira firecrest, <em>Regulus madeirensis</em>. A fossil ancestor of the firecrest has been identified from a single wing bone.<br/><br/>This kinglet is greenish above and has whitish underparts. It has two white wingbars, a black eye stripe and a white supercilium. The head crest, orange in the male and yellow in the female, is displayed during breeding, and gives rise to the English and scientific names for the species. This bird superficially resembles the goldcrest, which largely shares its European range, but the firecrest's bronze shoulders and strong face pattern are distinctive. The song is a repetition of high thin notes, slightly lower-pitched than those of its relative.<br/><br/>The common firecrest breeds in broadleaved or coniferous woodland and gardens, building its compact, three-layered nest on a tree branch. Seven to twelve eggs are incubated by the female alone. Both parents feed the chicks, which fledge 22&ndash;24 days after hatching. This kinglet is constantly on the move and frequently hovers as it searches for insects to eat, and in winter it is often found with flocks of tits. Despite some possible local declines, the species is not the subject of significant conservation concerns owing to its large European population and an expansion of its range over the last century. It may be hunted and killed by birds of prey, and can carry parasites. It is possible that this species was the original \"king of the birds\" in European folklore.<br/><br/>The common firecrest is a small plump bird, 9&nbsp;cm (3.5&nbsp;in) in length with a wingspan of 13&ndash;16&nbsp;cm (5.1&ndash;6.3&nbsp;in), and weighs 4&ndash;7 grams (0.14&ndash;0.25&nbsp;oz). It has bright olive-green upperparts with a bronze-coloured patch on each shoulder, and whitish underparts washed with brownish-grey on the breast and flanks. It has two white wingbars, a tiny black pointed bill, and brownish-black legs. The head pattern is striking, with a black eye stripe, long white supercilium, and a crest which is bright yellow in the female and mainly orange in the male. The sexes are very similar, apart from the crest colour, although the female is a little duller in plumage and on average slightly smaller. Juveniles have a grey tinge to the duller upperparts, and lack the coloured crown; the other head markings are present, but duller than in the adult. By their first winter, only the flight and tail feathers remain unmoulted, and the young birds are virtually indistinguishable from the adults in the field. This kinglet usually hops with its body held horizontally, and its flight is weak and whirring, with occasional quick evasive turns.<br/><br/>Adult firecrests are unlikely to be confused with any other species; Pallas's warbler has a similar head and wing pattern, but its crown stripe is pale lemon, not bright yellow or orange, and its supercilium is also pale yellow, not bright white. The juvenile common firecrest might be confused with the goldcrest, but usually shows enough face pattern to distinguish it from its relative, which has a very plain face at all ages. The firecrest can also be separated from Pallas's warbler by the warbler's pale crown stripe and yellow rump. There is more likelihood of confusing the juvenile firecrest with the yellow-browed warbler, which has a similar head pattern; the warbler (an Asiatic species) has pale fringes to the feathers of the closed wing, a whitish belly and darker brown legs. The yellow-browed warbler also lacks the pale half circle present below the young firecrest's eye.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"species": "europaea",
			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian nuthatch</strong> or <strong>wood nuthatch</strong> (<em>Sitta europaea</em>) is a small passerine bird found throughout temperate Asia and in Europe, where its name is the <strong>nuthatch</strong>. Like other nuthatches, it is a short-tailed bird with a long bill, blue-grey upperparts and a black eye-stripe. It is a vocal bird with a repeated loud <em>dwip</em> call. There are more than 20 subspecies in three main groups; birds in the west of the range have orange-buff underparts and a white throat, those in Russia have whitish underparts, and those in the Far East have a similar appearance to European birds, but lack the white throat.<br/><br/>The preferred habitat is mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If the entrance to the hole is too large, the female plasters it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6&ndash;9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.<br/><br/>The Eurasian nuthatch eats mainly insects, particularly caterpillars and beetles, although in autumn and winter its diet is supplemented with nuts and seeds. The young are fed mainly on insects, with some seeds, food items mainly being found on tree trunks and large branches. The nuthatch can forage when descending trees head first, as well as when climbing. It readily visits bird tables, eating fatty man-made food items as well as seeds. It is an inveterate hoarder, storing food year-round. Its main natural predator is the Eurasian sparrowhawk.<br/><br/>Fragmentation of woodland can lead to local losses of breeding birds, but the species' range is still expanding. It has a large population and huge breeding area, and is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as being of least concern.<br/><br/>The adult male of the nominate subspecies, <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;europaea</em> is 14&nbsp;cm (5.5&nbsp;in) long with a 22.5&ndash;27&nbsp;cm (8.9&ndash;10.6&nbsp;in) wingspan. It weighs 17&ndash;28&nbsp;g (0.6&ndash;1&nbsp;oz). It has blue-grey upperparts, a black eye-stripe and whitish throat and underparts. The flanks and lower belly are orange-red, mottled with white on the undertail. The stout bill is dark grey with a paler area on the base of the lower mandible, the iris is dark brown and the legs and feet are pale brown or greyish. Most other members of the <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;europaea</em> group differ only in detail from the nominate form, often with respect to the hue of the underparts, but <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;arctica</em> is quite distinctive. It is large, pale, has a white forehead and a reduced eye-stripe, and it has more white in the tail and wings than any other subspecies. Nuthatches move on trees with short leaps, and do not use their tails for support. In flight, they have a characteristic appearance, with a pointed head, round wings and a short, square tail. Their flight is fast, with wings closed between beats, and is usually of short duration.<br/><br/><em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;caesia</em>, the most widespread of the western subspecies, has orange-buff underparts except for a white throat and cheeks. The other western forms mainly differ in the exact shade of the underparts, although some southeastern forms also show a white forehead and supercilium. <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;sinensis</em> and <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;formosana</em>, of China and Taiwan respectively, have buff underparts like the western races, but have buff, instead of white, throats.<br/><br/>The female is similar in appearance to the male, but may be identified by her slightly paler upperparts, a browner eyestripe and a more washed-out tone to the flanks and lower belly. In the eastern form, <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;asiatica</em>, some males have buff underparts like the female, and birds with this appearance are difficult to sex in the field. Young birds resemble the female, although their plumage is duller and they have paler legs. Individuals can be reliably sexed as female from about 12&nbsp;days old by their paler and buffer flanks, or, in some white-breasted subspecies, by the creamier hue of their underparts.<br/><br/>Adults have a complete moult after breeding which takes about 80 days, starting from late May onwards and finishing by late September. The moult period for Siberian birds is more compressed, running from June to mid-September. Fledged juveniles moult some of their wing coverts when they are about eight weeks old.<br/><br/>In much of its range, Eurasian is the only nuthatch present. In southeast Europe and southwest Asia, the western and eastern rock nuthatches are larger and paler than the Eurasian species. They also lack white spots in the tail and are usually found in a different, stony habitat, and Kr&uuml;per's nuthatch is small and has a black cap and reddish breast patch. In southwest China, the chestnut-vented nuthatch is very similar to the European bird, but is darker above, has less white on the face and has greyer underparts.<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>The Eurasian nuthatch calls frequently, usually with a loud, sharp <em>dwip</em> normally repeated twice, sometimes more often if excited. It has a shrill <em>sirrrr</em> or <em>tsi-si-si</em> alarm call, and a thin <em>tsit</em> pre-flight call. The song is a slow whistled <em>pee-pee-pee</em> with many variants, including a faster version, and may be intermingled with the call.<br/><br/>The song of the distinctive <em>S.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;arctica</em> is said to be noticeably different from that of its relatives, which would help to establish whether it is a full species, but there has been insufficient research into its vocalizations.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>Eurasian wren</strong> (<em>Troglodytes troglodytes</em>) is a very small bird, and the only member of the wren family Troglodytidae found in Eurasia and Africa (Maghreb). In Anglophone Europe, it is commonly known simply as the <strong>wren</strong>. It was once lumped with <em>Troglodytes hiemalis</em> of eastern North America and <em>Troglodytes pacificus</em> of western North America as the winter wren. The Eurasian wren occurs in Europe, a belt of Asia from northern Iran and Afghanistan across to Japan. It is migratory in only the northern parts of its range. It is also highly polygynous, an unusual mating system for passerines.<br/><br/>The scientific name is taken from the Greek word \"troglodytes\" (from \"trogle\" a hole, and \"dyein\" to creep), meaning \"cave-dweller\", and refers to its habit of disappearing into cavities or crevices whilst hunting arthropods or to roost. The taxonomy of the genus <em>Troglodytes</em> is currently unresolved, as recent molecular studies have suggested that <em>Cistothorus</em> spp. and <em>Thryorchilus</em> spp. are within the clade currently defined by <em>Troglodytes</em>.<br/><br/>The 9- to 10.5-cm-long and 6-10 g wren is rufous brown above, greyer beneath, barred with darker brown and grey, even on wings and tail. The bill is dark brown, the legs pale brown. Young birds are less distinctly barred.<br/><br/>The plumage is subject to considerable variation, and where populations have been isolated, the variation has become fixed in one minor form or another. There are around 27 subspecies of this taxonomically complex bird. The disputed subspecies <em>orii</em>, the Daito winter wren, became extinct around 1940 &ndash; if it is indeed a valid taxon and not merely based on an anomaly.<br/><br/>Thus in Scotland, in addition to the typical bird <em>T. t. indigenus</em>, there are three distinct insular subspecies: one, <em>T. t. hirtensis</em>, is confined to the island of St Kilda; another, <em>T. t. zetlandicus</em>, to Shetland; and the third, <em>T. t. fridariensis</em>, to Fair Isle. The St Kilda wren is greyer above, whiter beneath, with more abundant bars on the back; the Shetland wren and Fair Isle wren are darker.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

			"Commonname": "Common Starling",
			"Genus": "Sturnus",
			"species": "vulgaris",
			"Description": "The <strong>common starling</strong> (<em>Sturnus vulgaris</em>), also known as the <strong>European starling</strong>, or in the British Isles just the <strong>starling</strong>, is a medium-sized passerine bird in the starling family, Sturnidae. It is about 20&nbsp;cm (8&nbsp;in) long and has glossy black plumage with a metallic sheen, which is speckled with white at some times of year. The legs are pink and the bill is black in winter and yellow in summer; young birds have browner plumage than the adults. It is a noisy bird, especially in communal roosts and other gregarious situations, with an unmusical but varied song. Its gift for mimicry has been noted in literature including the <em>Mabinogion</em> and the works of Pliny the Elder and William Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The common starling has about a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its nativen temperate Europe and western Asia, and it has been introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, South Africa and Fiji. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, pale blue eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of invertebrates, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey, and is host to a range of external and internal parasites.<br/><br/>Large flocks typical of this species can be beneficial to agriculture by controlling invertebrate pests; however, starlings can also be pests themselves when they feed on fruit and sprouting crops. Common starlings may also be a nuisance through the noise and mess caused by their large urban roosts. Introduced populations in particular have been subjected to a range of controls, including culling, but these have had limited success except in preventing the colonisation of Western Australia.<br/><br/>The species has declined in numbers in parts of northern and western Europe since the 1980s due to fewer grassland invertebrates being available as food for growing chicks. Despite this, its huge global population is not thought to be declining significantly, so the common starling is classified as being of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.<br/><br/>The common starling is 19&ndash;23&nbsp;cm (7.5&ndash;9.1&nbsp;in) long, with a wingspan of 31&ndash;44&nbsp;cm (12&ndash;17&nbsp;in) and a weight of 58&ndash;101&nbsp;g (2.0&ndash;3.6&nbsp;oz). Among standard measurements, the wing chord is 11.8 to 13.8&nbsp;cm (4.6 to 5.4&nbsp;in), the tail is 5.8 to 6.8&nbsp;cm (2.3 to 2.7&nbsp;in), the culmen is 2.5 to 3.2&nbsp;cm (0.98 to 1.26&nbsp;in) and the tarsus is 2.7 to 3.2&nbsp;cm (1.1 to 1.3&nbsp;in). The plumage is iridescent black, glossed purple or green, and spangled with white, especially in winter. The underparts of adult male common starlings are less spotted than those of adult females at a given time of year. The throat feathers of males are long and loose and are used in display while those of females are smaller and more pointed. The legs are stout and pinkish- or greyish-red. The bill is narrow and conical with a sharp tip; in the winter it is brownish-black but in summer, females have lemon yellow beaks while males have yellow bills with blue-grey bases. Moulting occurs once a year- in late summer after the breeding season has finished; the fresh feathers are prominently tipped white (breast feathers) or buff (wing and back feathers), which gives the bird a speckled appearance. The reduction in the spotting in the breeding season is achieved through the white feather tips largely wearing off. Juveniles are grey-brown and by their first winter resemble adults though often retaining some brown juvenile feathering, especially on the head. They can usually be sexed by the colour of the irises, rich brown in males, mouse-brown or grey in females. Estimating the contrast between an iris and the central always-dark pupil is 97% accurate in determining sex, rising to 98% if the length of the throat feathers is also considered. The common starling is mid-sized by both starling standards and passerine standards. It is readily distinguished from other mid-sized passerines, such as thrushes, icterids or small corvids, by its relatively short tail, sharp, blade-like bill, round-bellied shape and strong, sizeable (and rufous-coloured) legs. In flight, its strongly pointed wings and dark colouration are distinctive, while on the ground its strange, somewhat waddling gait is also characteristic. The colouring and build usually distinguish this bird from other starlings, although the closely related spotless starling may be physically distinguished by the lack of iridescent spots in adult breeding plumage.<br/><br/>Like most terrestrial starlings the common starling moves by walking or running, rather than hopping. Their flight is quite strong and direct; their triangular-shaped wings beat very rapidly, and periodically the birds glide for a short way without losing much height before resuming powered flight. When in a flock, the birds take off almost simultaneously, wheel and turn in unison, form a compact mass or trail off into a wispy stream, bunch up again and land in a coordinated fashion. Common starling on migration can fly at 60&ndash;80&nbsp;km/h (37&ndash;50&nbsp;mph) and cover up to 1,000&ndash;1,500&nbsp;km (620&ndash;930&nbsp;mi).<br/><br/>Several terrestrial starlings, including those in the genus <em>Sturnus</em>, have adaptations of the skull and muscles that help with feeding by probing. This adaptation is most strongly developed in the common starling (along with the spotless and white-cheeked starlings), where the protractor muscles responsible for opening the jaw are enlarged and the skull is narrow, allowing the eye to be moved forward to peer down the length of the bill. This technique involves inserting the bill into the ground and opening it as a way of searching for hidden food items. Common starlings have the physical traits that enable them to use this feeding technique, which has undoubtedly helped the species spread far and wide.<br/><br/>In Iberia, the western Mediterranean and northwest Africa, the common starling may be confused with the closely related spotless starling, the plumage of which, as its name implies, has a more uniform colour. At close range it can be seen that the latter has longer throat feathers, a fact particularly noticeable when it sings.<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>The common starling is a noisy bird. Its song consists of a wide variety of both melodic and mechanical-sounding noises as part of a ritual succession of sounds. The male is the main songster and engages in bouts of song lasting for a minute or more. Each of these typically includes four varieties of song type, which follow each other in a regular order without pause. The bout starts with a series of pure-tone whistles and these are followed by the main part of the song, a number of variable sequences that often incorporate snatches of song mimicked from other species of bird and various naturally occurring or man-made noises. The structure and simplicity of the sound mimicked is of greater importance than the frequency with which it occurs. In some instances, a wild starling has been observed to mimic a sound it has heard only once. Each sound clip is repeated several times before the bird moves on to the next. After this variable section comes a number of types of repeated clicks followed by a final burst of high-frequency song, again formed of several types. Each bird has its own repertoire with more proficient birds having a range of up to 35 variable song types and as many as 14 types of clicks.<br/><br/>Males sing constantly as the breeding period approaches and perform less often once pairs have bonded. In the presence of a female, a male sometimes flies to his nest and sings from the entrance, apparently attempting to entice the female in. Older birds tend to have a wider repertoire than younger ones. Those males that engage in longer bouts of singing and that have wider repertoires attract mates earlier and have greater reproductive success than others. Females appear to prefer mates with more complex songs, perhaps because this indicates greater experience or longevity. Having a complex song is also useful in defending a territory and deterring less experienced males from encroaching.<br/><br/>Singing also occurs outside the breeding season, taking place throughout the year apart from the moulting period. The songsters are more commonly male although females also sing on occasion. The function of such out-of-season song is poorly understood. Eleven other types of call have been described including a flock call, threat call, attack call, snarl call and copulation call. The alarm call is a harsh scream, and while foraging together common starlings squabble incessantly. They chatter while roosting and bathing, making a great deal of noise that can cause irritation to people living nearby. When a flock of common starlings is flying together, the synchronised movements of the birds' wings make a distinctive whooshing sound that can be heard hundreds of metres (yards) away.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

Other common names include the <strong>rufous scrub robin</strong>, <strong>rufous bush chat</strong>, <strong>rufous bush robin</strong> and the <strong>rufous warbler</strong>. It breeds around the Mediterranean and east to Pakistan. It also breeds south of the Sahara from the Sahel region east to Somalia; these African birds are sometimes considered to be a separate species, the <strong>African scrub robin</strong> (<em>C. minor</em>). It is partially migratory, wintering in Africa (Kenya, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia) and India. This is a very rare visitor to northern Europe.<br/><br/>The scientific name is from Ancient Greek. <em>Cercotrichas</em> is from <em>kerkos</em>, \"tail\" and <em>trikhas</em>, \"thrush\", and <em>galactotes</em> means resembling milk, from <em>galaktos</em>, \"milk\".<br/><br/>The rufous-tailed scrub robin is a bird of dry open country with bushes and shrubs. It builds its nest a few feet off the ground; there are three to five eggs is a typical clutch.<br/><br/>The rufous-tailed scrub robin is larger than the European robin. It has brown upper parts, whitish under parts, and a prominent whitish eye-stripe. The western race has a paler, warmer brown back than birds in southeastern Europe and Asia. The long rufous tail is frequently fanned, showing the black and white tips of the tail feathers. The adult male and female have similar plumage and the juvenile resembles the adult but is paler. These birds feed on insects mostly caught on the ground. Their clear thrush-like song has a sad tone<br/><br/>Adult male and female rufous-tailed scrub robin look alike and measure about 6 inches (150&nbsp;mm) long with relatively long legs and a large rounded tail. The upper parts are a rich brownish chestnut, with the rump and upper tail-coverts rather more rufous. There is a distinct curved, creamy-white broad streak from the nostrils to behind the eye and a dark brown line through the eye. The under-eye area is whitish and the ear coverts pale brown. The eye and the beak are both brown but the lower mandible of the beak has a greyish base. The underparts are buffish white, with the chin, central belly and under tail coverts paler than the other parts. The feathers of the wing are dark brown, fringed on the leading edge with buff and on the trailing edge with pale chestnut-brown and with the secondaries tipped with white. The central pair of feathers on the tail are bright rufous-chestnut with narrow black tips and the rest a similar colour with white tips and adjacent broad black bands. The legs and feet are pale brown. Juveniles are similar in appearance but generally a paler sandy-brown colour. The plumage is moulted in the autumn and prior to this, the white tips of the tail feathers may have become reduced in size or worn off.<br/><br/>The song is a somewhat lark-like but often disjointed series of notes, sometimes clear and loud but at other times soft, and is sung from an elevated position near the top of a tree, on a pole or on a wire. It has been described as having a sad tone.<br/><br/>(From Wikipedia)",

It is a regular passage migrant in western Europe, whereas the collared flycatcher which breeds further west is rare. This is because of the different migration direction.<br/><br/>The Asian species <em>Ficedula albicilla</em>, previously considered a subspecies of the red-breasted flycatcher, has the red throat surrounded by grey and a different song. It is usually now separated as the taiga flycatcher (Pallas, 1811).<br/><br/>The breeding male of this small 11&ndash;12&nbsp;cm long flycatcher is mainly brown above and white below, with a grey head and orange throat. The bill is black and has the broad but pointed shape typical of aerial insectivores. As well as taking insects in flight, this species hunts caterpillars amongst the oak foliage, and will take berries.

			"Description": "The <strong>whinchat</strong> (<em>Saxicola rubetra</em>) is a small migratory passerine bird breeding in Europe and western Asia and wintering in central Africa. At one time considered to be in the thrush family, Turdidae, it is now placed in the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Both sexes have a strong supercilium, brownish upper parts mottled darker, a pale throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers, but in the breeding season, the male has an orange-buff throat and breast.<br/><br/>The whinchat is a solitary species, favouring open grassy country with rough vegetation and scattered small shrubs. It perches in elevated locations ready to pounce on the insects and other small invertebrates that form its diet. The nest is built by the female on the ground in coarse vegetation, with a clutch of four to seven eggs being laid. The hen incubates the eggs for about thirteen days and then both parents feed the nestlings. Fledging takes place about eighteen days after hatching and the parents continue to feed the young for another fortnight. Moulting takes place in late summer before the migration southwards, and again on the wintering grounds in Africa before the migration northwards in spring. The whinchat is a common species with a wide range and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified it as being of \"least concern\".<br/><br/>The whinchat is a short-tailed bird, moving on the ground with small, rapid hops and frequently bobbing and flicking its wings and tail. It is similar in size to its relative the European robin (<em>Erithacus rubecula</em>), being 12 to 14&nbsp;cm (4.7 to 5.5&nbsp;in) long and weighing 13 to 26&nbsp;g (0.46 to 0.92&nbsp;oz). Both sexes have brownish upperparts mottled darker, a buff throat and breast, a pale buff to whitish belly, and a blackish tail with white bases to the outer tail feathers.<br/><br/>The male in breeding plumage has a blackish face mask almost encircled by a strong white supercilium and malar stripe, a bright orange-buff throat and breast, and small white wing patches on the greater coverts and inner median coverts. The female is duller overall, in particular having browner face mask, pale buffy-brown breast, and a buff supercilium and malar stripe, and smaller or no white wing patches. Males in immature and winter plumage are similar to females, except that adult males retain the white wing patches all year round.<br/><br/>Though fairly similar to females and immatures of the European stonechat (<em>S. rubicola</em>), the whinchat can readily be distinguished by its conspicuous supercilium and whiter belly, and also in western Europe, by being paler overall than the western European stonechat subspecies <em>S. rubicola hibernans</em>. It also differs structurally in being slightly slimmer and less 'dumpy', and having longer wingtips (an adaptation to its long-distance migration). It is more easily confused with female or immature Siberian stonechat (<em>S. maura</em>), which (also being a long-distance migrant) shares the longer wingtips; however, Siberian stonechat can be distinguished by its conspicuous unmarked pale orange-buff rump (in whinchat, the rump is the same mottled brown colour as the back).<br/><br/>Its main call is described as a <em>hue-tac-tac</em>, the 'tac' softer and less grating than that of the European stonechat; the call is used both for contact between birds and predator alarms. The male has a whistling, crackly but soft song used during the breeding season, consisting of a mixture of soft whistles, tacs and more grating sounds; it is often mimetic, including phrases from the songs of at least 12 other assorted bird species. It sings from a fence, bush, tree or wire, or occasionally from the ground or in flight, between about April and July. On the wintering grounds, it often gives alarm calls but only occasionally sings, being most likely to do so at the end of winter, when starting spring migration.<br/><br/>&nbsp;(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>mistle thrush</strong> (<em>Turdus viscivorus</em>) is a bird common to much of Europe, Asia and North Africa. It is a year-round resident in much of its range, but northern and eastern populations migrate south for the winter, often in small flocks. It is a large thrush with pale grey-brown upperparts, a greyish-white chin and throat, and black spots on its pale yellow and off-white underparts. The sexes are similar in plumage, and its three subspecies show only minimal differences. The male has a loud, far-carrying song which is delivered even in wet and windy weather, earning the bird the old name of \"stormcock\".<br/><br/>Found in open woods, parks, hedges and cultivated land, the mistle thrush feeds on a wide variety of invertebrates, seeds and berries. Its preferred fruits including those of the mistletoe, holly and yew. Mistletoe is favoured where it is available, and this is reflected in the thrush's English and scientific names; the plant, a parasitic species, benefits from its seeds being excreted by the thrush onto branches where they can germinate. In winter, a mistle thrush will vigorously defend mistletoe clumps or a holly tree as a food reserve for when times are hard.<br/><br/>The open cup nest is built against a trunk or in a forked branch, and is fearlessly defended against potential predators, sometimes including humans or cats. The clutch, typically of thre<br/><br/>The mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to Europe. The nominate subspecies measures 27&ndash;28&nbsp;cm (11&ndash;11&nbsp;in) in length, with a 45&nbsp;cm (18&nbsp;in) wingspan. It weighs 93 to 167&nbsp;g (3.3 to 5.9&nbsp;oz), with an average of around 130&nbsp;g (4.6&nbsp;oz). It has a stocky upright posture when on the ground. It has pale grey-brown upperparts, the chin and throat are greyish-white, and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots. The spotting becomes denser on the lower chest, giving the appearance of a breast-band. The long tail has white tips on the outer feathers, and the underwing coverts are white. The eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower mandible. The legs and feet are yellowish-brown. There are no plumage differences between the sexes. Juveniles are similar to adults, but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts. By their first winter they are very similar to adults, but the underparts are usually more buff-toned.<br/><br/>The eastern subspecies <em>T. v. bonapartei</em> is 30&nbsp;cm (12&nbsp;in) in length, and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form. It is paler grey above and whiter below, with fewer black spots. Birds of intermediate appearance are seen west of the Ob River where the range overlaps with <em>viscivorus</em>. The southern race <em>T. v. deichleri</em> resembles <em>bonapartei</em> in appearance, but is closer in size to the nominate <em>viscivorus</em>, although it has a more slender bill.<br/><br/>Adults have a full moult after breeding, beginning between late May and the end of June, and completed by early October. Juvenile birds have a partial moult, replacing their head, body, and covert feathers; this is completed by October, although the start of the moult depends on when the chicks hatched.<br/><br/>The mistle thrush is much larger, paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush. In the western Himalayas it could be confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes. These are similar to the mistle thrush, but the plain&ndash;backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars, is more rufous above than its relative, and is barred rather than spotted below. The long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts, bars on its breast and two wing bars. Juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to White's thrush, but that species has golden-yellow plumage, scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern.<br/><br/>e to five eggs, is incubated for 12&ndash;15&nbsp;days, mainly by the female. The chicks fledge about 14&ndash;16&nbsp;days after hatching. There are normally two broods. There was a large range expansion in the 18th and early 19th centuries, although there has been a small decline in recent decades, perhaps due to changes in agricultural practices. Given its high numbers and very large range, this thrush is classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.<br/><b>Voice</b> <br/><br/>The male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles, sounding like <em>chewee-trewuu&nbsp;... trureetruuruu</em> or similar, repeated three to six times, and used to advertise his territory, attract a mate and maintain the pair bond. The tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird, but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower. The song is, however, much louder, often audible up to 2&nbsp;km (2,000&nbsp;yd) away. The song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from November to early June. The male is most vocal in the early morning, and its tendency to sing after, and sometimes during, wet and windy weather led to the old name \"stormcock\". The song may be heard in any month, although it is uncommon from July to August while the thrush is moulting. The main call, given by both sexes, is a dry chattering <em>krrrr</em>, louder when it is alarmed or excited. It is often likened to the sound of a football rattle, a form of musical ratchet. There is also a squeaky <em>tuk</em> contact call.<br/><br/>&nbsp;(From Wikipedia)",

It has brown upperparts and black-spotted cream or buff underparts and has three recognised subspecies. Its distinctive song, which has repeated musical phrases, has frequently been referred to in poetry.<br/><br/>The song thrush breeds in forests, gardens and parks, and is partially migratory with many birds wintering in southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East; it has also been introduced into New Zealand and Australia. Although it is not threatened globally, there have been serious population declines in parts of Europe, possibly due to changes in farming practices.<br/><br/>The song thrush builds a neat mud-lined cup nest in a bush or tree and lays four to five dark-spotted blue eggs. It is omnivorous and has the habit of using a favourite stone as an \"anvil\" on which to break open the shells of snails. Like other perching birds (passerines), it is affected by external and internal parasites and is vulnerable to predation by cats and birds of prey.<br/><br/>The song thrush (as represented by the nominate subspecies <em>T. p. philomelos</em>) is 20 to 23.5&nbsp;centimetres (8 to 9.25&nbsp;in) in length and weighs 50&ndash;107&nbsp;grammes (1.8 to 3.8&nbsp;oz). The sexes are similar, with plain brown backs and neatly black-spotted cream or yellow-buff underparts, becoming paler on the belly. The underwing is warm yellow, the bill is yellowish and the legs and feet are pink. The upperparts of this species become colder in tone from west to east across the breeding range from Sweden to Siberia. The juvenile resembles the adult, but has buff or orange streaks on the back and wing coverts.<br/><br/>The most similar European thrush species is the redwing (<em>T. iliacus</em>), but that bird has a strong white supercilium, red flanks, and shows a red underwing in flight. The mistle thrush (<em>T. viscivorus</em>) is much larger and has white tail corners, and the Chinese thrush (<em>T. mupinensis</em>), although much more similar in plumage, has black face markings and does not overlap in range.<br/><br/>The song thrush has a short, sharp <em>tsip</em> call, replaced on migration by a thin high <em>seep</em>, similar to the redwing's call but shorter. The alarm call is a <em>chook-chook</em> becoming shorter and more strident with increasing danger. The male's song, given from trees, rooftops or other elevated perches, is a loud clear run of musical phrases, repeated two to four times, <em>filip filip filip codidio codidio quitquiquit tittit tittit tereret tereret tereret</em>, and interspersed with grating notes and mimicry. It is given mainly from February to June by the Outer Hebridean race, but from November to July by the more widespread subspecies. For its weight, this species has one of the loudest bird calls.<br/><br/>An individual male may have a repertoire of more than 100&nbsp;phrases, many copied from its parents and neighbouring birds.

It is also called <strong>Eurasian blackbird</strong> (especially in North America, to distinguish it from the unrelated New World blackbirds), or simply <strong>blackbird</strong> where this does not lead to confusion with a similar-looking local species. It breeds in Europe, Asia, and North Africa, and has been introduced to Canada, United States, Mexico, Peru, Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, the Falkland Islands, Chile, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand. It has a number of subspecies across its large range; a few of the Asian subspecies are sometimes considered to be full species. Depending on latitude, the common blackbird may be resident, partially migratory, or fully migratory.<br/><br/>The male of the nominate subspecies, which is found throughout most of Europe, is all black except for a yellow eye-ring and bill and has a rich, melodious song; the adult female and juvenile have mainly dark brown plumage. This species breeds in woods and gardens, building a neat, mud-lined, cup-shaped nest. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of insects, earthworms, berries, and fruits.<br/><br/>Both sexes are territorial on the breeding grounds, with distinctive threat displays, but are more gregarious during migration and in wintering areas.

The juvenile is similar to the female, but has pale spots on the upperparts, and the very young juvenile also has a speckled breast. Young birds vary in the shade of brown, with darker birds presumably males.

			"Description": "The <strong>fieldfare</strong> (<em>Turdus pilaris</em>) is a member of the thrush family Turdidae. It breeds in woodland and scrub in northern Europe and Asia. It is strongly migratory, with many northern birds moving south during the winter. It is a very rare breeder in the British Isles, but winters in large numbers in the United Kingdom, Southern Europe, North Africa and the Middle East. It is omnivorous, eating a wide range of molluscs, insects and earthworms in the summer, and berries, grain and seeds in the winter.<br/><br/>Fieldfares often nest in small colonies, possibly for protection from predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight. There may be two broods in southern parts of the range but only one further north. Migrating birds and wintering birds often form large flocks, often in the company of Redwings.<br/><br/>The fieldfare is 25&nbsp;cm (10&nbsp;in) long, with a grey crown, neck and rump, a plain brown back, dark wings and tail and white underwings. The breast and flanks are heavily spotted. The breast has a reddish wash and the rest of the underparts are white. The sexes are similar in appearance but the females are slightly more brown. The male has a simple chattering song and the birds have various guttural flight and alarm calls.<br/><br/>The fieldfare is easily recognisable with its slate-grey head, nape and rump, dark brown back, blackish tail and boldly speckled breast. In flight, its white under wing-coverts and axillaries are conspicuous. The harsh flight call \"tsak tsak\" is also distinctive.<br/><br/>The forehead and crown of the male are bluish-grey and each feather has a central brownish-black band. The lores and under-eye regions are black and there are faint, pale streaks above the eyes. The ear coverts, nape, hind neck and rump are bluish-grey, usually with a white streak near the shaft of each rump feather. The scapulars and mantle feathers are dark chestnut-brown with dark central streaks and pale tips. There are fourteen tail feathers each with a pointed tip, the outer two slightly shorter than the others giving a rounded tail. They are brownish-black, with inconspicuous darker bars visible in some lights. The outer edge of each tail feather is fringed with grey near the base and the outer pair of feathers have a narrow white border on the inner edge. The chin, throat and upper breast are creamy-buff with bold streaks and speckles of brownish-black. The lower breast is creamy-white with a diminishing buff tinge and fewer speckles and the belly is similarly creamy-white, with the speckles restricted to the uppermost parts. The primaries are brownish-black with the leading edge fringed grey and the inner edge of the outer feathers grey near the base whereas the inner feathers are fringed with brown near the base. The secondaries are similar but fringed with chestnut-brown on the leading edge. The upper wing-coverts are brownish-black and similar to the outer primaries in their margin colouration. The axillaries and under wing-coverts are white and the under tail-coverts have dark greyish-brown bases and margins and white centres and tips. The beak is strong, with a slight curve and a notch near the tip. It is orange-yellow in winter, with the upper mandible somewhat brownish and both mandible tips brownish-black. In the summer both mandibles of the male's beak are yellow. The irises are dark brown and the legs and feet are brown. The average adult length is 25&nbsp;cm (9.8&nbsp;in), the winglength is 14.5&nbsp;cm (5.7&nbsp;in) and the tarsal length 3.5&nbsp;cm (1.4&nbsp;in).<br/><br/>The female is very similar to the male but the upper parts are somewhat more brownish and the feathers on the crown have narrower black central stripes. The throat and breast are paler with fewer, smaller markings. The beak is similar to the male's winter beak. The juvenile are a duller colour than the adults with pale coloured streaks on the feathers that have dark streaks in the adult. The young assume their adult plumage after their first moult in the autumn.<br/><br/>The call is mostly uttered in flight and is a harsh \"tsak tsak tsuk\". The same sound, but softer, is made more conversationally when individuals gather in trees. When angry or alarmed they emit various warning sounds reminiscent of the mistle thrush (<em>Turdus viscivorous</em>). The male has a rather feeble song that he sings in the breeding season. It is a mixture of a few phrases like those of the common blackbird (<em>Turdus merula</em>) interspersed with whistles, guttural squeaks and call notes. This is sung on the wing and also from a tree and a subdued version of this song with more warbling notes is sung by a group of birds at communal roosts.<br/><br/>&nbsp;(From Wikipedia)",

			"Description": "The <strong>ring ouzel</strong> (<em>Turdus torquatus</em>) is a European member of the thrush family, Turdidae. It is the mountain equivalent of the closely related common blackbird, and breeds in gullies, rocky areas or scree slopes.<br/><br/>The adult male is all black except for a white crescent on the breast and a yellowish bill. The wings have a silvery appearance due to white feather edgings. The male sings its loud and mournful song from trees or rocks.<br/><br/>The female is similar but duller, and younger birds often lack the breast crescent. The juvenile has brown plumage.<br/><br/>This species was first described by Linnaeus in his <em>Systema naturae</em> in 1758 under its current scientific name.<br/><br/>&nbsp;(From Wikipedia)",
